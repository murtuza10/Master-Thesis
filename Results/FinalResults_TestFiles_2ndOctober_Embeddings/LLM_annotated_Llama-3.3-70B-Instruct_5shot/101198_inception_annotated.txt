To fill the JSON structure based on the provided input text, we first identify the entities that belong to the allowed subcategories: Crop, Location, and TimeStatement.

1. **Crop**: 
   - cropSpecies: None mentioned.
   - cropVariety: None mentioned.

2. **Location**:
   - country: None explicitly mentioned as a country, but "DE" is mentioned, which could imply Germany, though it's more commonly an abbreviation for "Deutschland" in German, it's not explicitly clear if it refers to the country in this context.
   - region: None mentioned.
   - city: None mentioned.
   - latitude: None mentioned.
   - longitude: None mentioned.

3. **TimeStatement**:
   - startTime: 2020, 2023 (November), and 2024 (August) are mentioned as start or reference points.
   - endTime: 2050 is mentioned as an end point.
   - duration: The period between 2020 and 2050 is implied.

Given the information and the rules provided, the JSON output focusing on the explicitly mentioned entities within the allowed subcategories would be:

```json
{
  "Crop": [],
  "Location": [],
  "TimeStatement": [
    {"TimeStatement": { "value": "2020", "span": [start_index, end_index] }},
    {"TimeStatement": { "value": "2023", "span": [start_index, end_index] }},
    {"TimeStatement": { "value": "2024", "span": [start_index, end_index] }},
    {"TimeStatement": { "value": "2050", "span": [start_index, end_index] }}
  ]
}
```

Note: The `start_index` and `end_index` values for each "TimeStatement" would need to be accurately determined based on the original text's indexing, which is not provided in the question. The above response assumes the detection of time statements and their general placement within the text. 

For the purpose of this example and given the constraints of the question, the exact indexing (`start_index` and `end_index`) for each time statement is not calculated, as it would require the full text with indexing or a clear method to determine these indices based on the text provided.
