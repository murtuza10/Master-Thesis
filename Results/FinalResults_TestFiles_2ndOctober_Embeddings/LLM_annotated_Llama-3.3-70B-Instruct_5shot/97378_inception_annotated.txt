To fill the JSON structure based on the input text, we need to identify entities that belong to the allowed subcategories: Crop, Location, and TimeStatement.

1. **Crop**: 
   - cropSpecies: None mentioned explicitly in the context of crops (e.g., wheat, maize).
   - cropVariety: None mentioned.

2. **Location**:
   - country: None mentioned explicitly.
   - region: "Nähe von Hildesheim" implies a region near Hildesheim, but "Hildesheim" itself is a city.
   - city: "Hildesheim".
   - latitude: None mentioned.
   - longitude: None mentioned.

3. **TimeStatement**:
   - startTime: None mentioned explicitly.
   - endTime: None mentioned explicitly.
   - duration: "über einen Zeitraum von 2 Jahren" implies a duration of 2 years, and "in einem 14-tägigen Zeitraster" implies a 14-day time frame.

Given the information:

- **Crop**: Since no specific crop species or variety is mentioned in the abstract related to the research focus, this category remains empty.
- **Location**: "Hildesheim" is identified as a city.
- **TimeStatement**: "2 Jahren" and "14-tägigen" are durations/time frames mentioned in the text.

The output in JSON format, considering the start and end indices of the identified entities in the text, would be:

```json
{
  "Crop": [],
  "Location": [
    {"Location": { "value": "Hildesheim", "span": [156, 165] }}
  ],
  "TimeStatement": [
    {"TimeStatement": { "value": "2 Jahren", "span": [204, 212] }},
    {"TimeStatement": { "value": "14-tägigen", "span": [174, 185] }}
  ]
}
```

Note: The span indices are approximate and based on the text provided. Actual indices might vary depending on the exact text format and encoding used.
