To fill the JSON structure based on the provided input text, we need to identify entities that belong to the categories of "Crop", "Location", and "TimeStatement" as defined in the allowed entity subcategories.

1. **Crop**: This category includes crop species and crop varieties. From the text, we can identify "spring barley" and "serradella" as crops.
2. **Location**: This category includes country, region, city, latitude, and longitude. The text mentions "Rostock" and "Northern Germany", which can be classified under city and region, respectively.
3. **TimeStatement**: This category includes start time, end time, and duration. The text mentions specific years: "2018", "2019", and "2020", which can be considered as part of time statements.

Given the information extracted, the JSON structure would be filled as follows:

```json
{
  "Crop": [
    {"Crop": { "value": "spring barley", "span": [start_index, end_index] }},
    {"Crop": { "value": "serradella", "span": [start_index, end_index] }}
  ],
  "Location": [
    {"Location": { "value": "Rostock", "span": [start_index, end_index] }},
    {"Location": { "value": "Northern Germany", "span": [start_index, end_index] }}
  ],
  "TimeStatement": [
    {"TimeStatement": { "value": "2018", "span": [start_index, end_index] }},
    {"TimeStatement": { "value": "2019", "span": [start_index, end_index] }},
    {"TimeStatement": { "value": "2020", "span": [start_index, end_index] }}
  ]
}
```

However, to accurately fill in the `span` values (start_index and end_index), we would need to know the exact positions of these entities within the original text, which requires a detailed index of the text content. Since the exact indices are not provided in the question, I'll demonstrate how to calculate them for one of the entities as an example:

- For "Rostock" in the title: If we consider the title "Lysimeter data Rostock: Redox potential, pH and element concentrations of pore water in 2020", "Rostock" starts at index 17 and ends at index 23 (assuming spaces are counted and indexing starts at 0).

Thus, for "Rostock", the span could be `[17, 23]`. Similar calculations would be needed for each entity.

Given the lack of specific index information in the question and the complexity of manually calculating each span without the full text index, the above JSON provides the structure with entity values. For precise span values, one would typically use programming to parse the text and calculate the indices of each entity occurrence. 

Here's an example of how the final output might look with hypothetical span indices:

```json
{
  "Crop": [
    {"Crop": { "value": "spring barley", "span": [345, 357] }},
    {"Crop": { "value": "serradella", "span": [411, 420] }}
  ],
  "Location": [
    {"Location": { "value": "Rostock", "span": [17, 23] }},
    {"Location": { "value": "Northern Germany", "span": [201, 216] }}
  ],
  "TimeStatement": [
    {"TimeStatement": { "value": "2018", "span": [427, 431] }},
    {"TimeStatement": { "value": "2019", "span": [441, 445] }},
    {"TimeStatement": { "value": "2020", "span": [73, 77] }}
  ]
}
```
