To fill the JSON structure based on the input text, we need to identify entities that belong to the allowed subcategories: Crop, Location, and TimeStatement.

1. **Crop**: The text mentions "Norway spruce" and its scientific name "Picea abies." This is a crop species.
2. **Location**: The text mentions "Western Germany" and "Europe" as locations. Additionally, it mentions "33 German trial sites," which implies Germany as a location.
3. **TimeStatement**: The text mentions specific years and ages related to the measurement of phenotypic traits, such as "over a period of 51 years," "1964/68," and various ages (7, 10, 13, 16, 21, 29, 39, 51).

Here's how we can extract these entities into the required JSON structure:

```json
{
  "Crop": [
    {"Crop": { "value": "Picea abies", "span": [46, 56] }},
    {"Crop": { "value": "Norway spruce", "span": [68, 81] }}
  ],
  "Location": [
    {"Location": { "value": "Western Germany", "span": [144, 158] }},
    {"Location": { "value": "Europe", "span": [200, 206] }},
    {"Location": { "value": "Germany", "span": [224, 231] }}
  ],
  "TimeStatement": [
    {"TimeStatement": { "value": "51 years", "span": [130, 137] }},
    {"TimeStatement": { "value": "1964/68", "span": [173, 179] }},
    {"TimeStatement": { "value": "7", "span": [249, 250] }},
    {"TimeStatement": { "value": "10", "span": [252, 253] }},
    {"TimeStatement": { "value": "13", "span": [255, 256] }},
    {"TimeStatement": { "value": "16", "span": [258, 259] }},
    {"TimeStatement": { "value": "21", "span": [273, 274] }},
    {"TimeStatement": { "value": "29", "span": [276, 277] }},
    {"TimeStatement": { "value": "39", "span": [279, 280] }},
    {"TimeStatement": { "value": "51", "span": [282, 283] }}
  ]
}
```
