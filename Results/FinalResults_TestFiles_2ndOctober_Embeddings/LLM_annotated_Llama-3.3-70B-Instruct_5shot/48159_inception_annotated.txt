To fill the JSON structure based on the provided input text, we need to identify entities that belong to the categories of "Crop", "Location", and "TimeStatement" as defined in the allowed entity subcategories.

1. **Crop**: There are no explicit mentions of crop species or varieties in the text.

2. **Location**: The text mentions "Germany" as a country, which falls under the "Location" category, specifically as a country name.

3. **TimeStatement**: The text mentions specific years ("1990" and "2017") that fall under the "TimeStatement" category, indicating the start and end years of the period in question.

Given these observations, the JSON output should be structured as follows:

```json
{
  "Crop": [],
  "Location": [
    {"Location": {"value": "Germany", "span": [51, 58]}},
    {"Location": {"value": "Germany", "span": [369, 376]}},
    {"Location": {"value": "European Union", "span": [233, 247]}}
  ],
  "TimeStatement": [
    {"TimeStatement": {"value": "1990", "span": [68, 72]}},
    {"TimeStatement": {"value": "2017", "span": [75, 79]}},
    {"TimeStatement": {"value": "1990", "span": [427, 431]}},
    {"TimeStatement": {"value": "2017", "span": [434, 438]}}
  ]
}
```

Note: The span indices are approximate and based on the text provided. They represent the start and end indices of the entity mentions in the text.
