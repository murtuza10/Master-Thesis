To fill the JSON structure based on the input text, we need to identify entities that belong to the allowed subcategories: Crop, Location, and TimeStatement.

From the input text, the following entities can be identified:

* "Wheat" is mentioned as part of "Wheat dwarf virus" but also as a crop in the context of "barley and other cereals" which implies "wheat" as a crop.
* "Barley" (Hordeum vulgare ssp. vulgare) is explicitly mentioned as a crop.
* No explicit locations (country, region, city, latitude, longitude) are mentioned.
* No explicit time statements (start time, end time, duration) are mentioned.

The entity "barley" appears in the text with the span [147, 153] (considering the text starts from "Title: Dataset:..."). The entity "wheat" appears in the context of "Wheat dwarf virus" but since it's part of the virus name, it's not directly considered a crop mention in this context. However, "wheat" is implied as a crop in the phrase "barley and other cereals," which includes wheat, appearing with the span [244, 249].

Given this analysis, the JSON output would be:

```json
{
  "Crop": [
    {"Crop": { "value": "barley", "span": [147, 153] }},
    {"Crop": { "value": "wheat", "span": [244, 249] }}
  ],
  "Location": [],
  "TimeStatement": []
}
```
