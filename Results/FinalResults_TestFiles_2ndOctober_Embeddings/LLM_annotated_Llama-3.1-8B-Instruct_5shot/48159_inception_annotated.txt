    {"TimeStatement": {"value": "2017", "span": [139, 143]}}
  ]
}
```

### Explanation ###

1. No crops are mentioned in the text, so the "Crop" list is empty.
2. The country "Germany" is mentioned twice, so it is included in the "Location" list twice.
3. The continent "Europe" is mentioned in the text, so it is included in the "Location" list.
4. The years "1990" and "2017" are mentioned as the start and end years of the data, so they are included in the "TimeStatement" list.
