    *   "Löss" (a type of soil texture).
    *   "28 cm" (a soil depth).
    Note that soil bulk density, pH, organic carbon, and available nitrogen are not explicitly mentioned in the text.
*   The location-related entities are not mentioned in the text.
*   The time-related entities mentioned are:
    *   "2017" (start year). The end year is not explicitly mentioned, so it is left empty.
