### Note: ###

*   "soil organic carbon" and "soil organic nitrogen" are extracted as soil organic carbon and soil available nitrogen respectively.
*   "CN Ratio" is extracted as soil pH because it is the ratio of carbon to nitrogen.
*   "temporal" is extracted as start time as it is related to time in the context of the given text.
