### Explanation of the Extraction Process: ###

- The title of the text does not contain any explicit entities.
- In the abstract text, the following entities were found:
  - **Crops**: "spring barley" is mentioned twice, and "serradella" is mentioned once.
  - **Soil**: "soil" is mentioned once, "Boden" (which means "soil" in German) is mentioned once, and "three sampling depths" is mentioned as a soil depth.
  - **Location**: "Northern Germany" is mentioned as a region.
  - **Time Statement**: The year 2018 is mentioned as the time when lysimeter monoliths were collected, 2019 is mentioned as the year when lysimeters were cropped with spring barley and catch-cropped with serradella, and 2020 is mentioned as the year when the experiment took place.
  - The duration of the experiment is mentioned as "about 3.5 months" in 2020.

- The keywords do not contain any explicit entities that are not already mentioned in the abstract text.
