    {"cropSpecies": { "value": "cropland", "span": [146, 154] }},
    {"cropSpecies": { "value": "grassland", "span": [163, 172] }}

```

### Note ###
- The text mentions "cropland" and "grassland" as crop species, so I added them to the "Crops" section.
- The text mentions "temperate agricultural soils" and "agricultural soils" as soil reference groups, so I added them to the "Soil" section.
- The text mentions "Germany" as a country, so I added it to the "Location" section.
- There are no time-related statements in the text, so the "Time Statement" section is empty.
