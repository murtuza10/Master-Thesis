### Explanation ###
The JSON structure has been filled based on the input text. The following entities have been extracted:

- **Crops**: Only "Mais" (corn) is mentioned, which is a crop species.
- **Soil**: Several soil-related entities have been extracted:
  - "Parabraunerde" is a soil reference group.
  - "Löss" is a soil texture.
  - "28 cm" is a soil depth.
  - Note that "soil bulk density" is not mentioned in the text, so it is included with an empty string as its value.
- **Location**: No location-related entities are mentioned in the text.
- **Time Statement**: The start time "2017" is mentioned, indicating the year when the experiment took place.
