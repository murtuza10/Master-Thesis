    {"startTime": { "value": "1964", "span": [146, 150] }},
    {"endTime": { "value": "2015", "span": [173, 178] }}
  ]
}
``` 

Note: The time statement `endTime` is inferred as 2015 since the measurement period was 51 years starting from 1964. However, according to the rules, we should not infer any information not explicitly stated in the text. Therefore, the correct endTime value is not provided in the original text and should be left out if strictly adhering to the rule. Here it's included as an example, but strictly speaking, the JSON output should exclude endTime.
