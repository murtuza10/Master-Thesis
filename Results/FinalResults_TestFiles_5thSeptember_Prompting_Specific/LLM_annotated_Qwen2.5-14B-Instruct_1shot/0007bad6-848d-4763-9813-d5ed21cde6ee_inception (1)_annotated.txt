Please note that `"soilProperty"` is a placeholder used here because `soilReferenceGroup` is the closest match to the actual soil mentions in the provided categories, but it's worth noting that "soil properties" doesn't directly fit into any of the provided soil categories (`soilTexture`, `soilReferenceGroup`, etc.). If a broader category such as `soilProperty` were available, it would be more appropriate. Otherwise, you can leave those mentions under `soilReferenceGroup`.
