Note: In German, "Deutschland" is translated to "Germany," but it's kept as "Deutschland" to match the original text. Similarly, "Bundesl채nder" translates to "Federal States," but it's also kept as "Bundesl채nder." The term "Bodenart" directly translates to "soil type" and "Bodentyp" is also related to soil type, but since "Bodenart" was the explicit term in the text and appears more frequently, it was included. Other terms are direct translations and are included as they appear in the text.
