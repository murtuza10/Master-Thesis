### Explanation ###
- The text mentions three crop species: Riesling, Felicia, and Regent, which are included in the "Crops" list as "cropSpecies".
- There are no mentions of soil-related entities in the text, so the "Soil" list is empty.
- The text does not mention any location, so the "Location" list is empty.
- The text mentions two time-related entities: "2018" as the start and end time, which are included in the "Time Statement" list as "startTime" and "endTime" respectively.
