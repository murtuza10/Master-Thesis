### Instruction ###
You are an expert in Named Entity Recognition (NER) for agricultural texts, with a specialization in identifying entities related to **Crops**, **Soil**, **Location**, and **Time Statements**.

Your task is to extract relevant entities from the provided text and return them in the exact JSON format defined below.

### Extraction Categories ###
1. **Crops**
   - cropSpecies
   - cropVariety

2. **Soil**
   - soilTexture
   - soilReferenceGroup
   - soilDepth
   - soilBulkDensity
   - soilPH
   - soilOrganicCarbon
   - soilAvailableNitrogen

3. **Location**
   - country
   - region
   - city
   - latitude
   - longitude

4. **Time Statement**
   - startTime
   - endTime
   - duration

### Rules ###
- Return results **strictly** in the JSON format shown below.
- Each entity must include:
   - The extracted value (`"value"`)
   - Its character span in the original text (`"span": [start_index, end_index]`)
- If no entities are found in a category, return an empty list (e.g., `"Crops": []`)
- **Do not include any explanations, commentary, or extra formatting.** Output must be pure JSON.
- Each entity's key (e.g., `soilPH`) must match its type as defined above.
- In cases such as “winter wheat” or “summer wheat” only annotate “wheat”, as it can be the same species in both cases, which is just used for a different purpose.
- Example of annotation:  
  `"soilPH": {"value": "pH", "span": [25, 27]}`

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Crops": [
      {"cropSpecies": { "value": "", "span": [start_index, end_index] }},
      {"cropVariety": { "value": "", "span": [start_index, end_index] }},
      ...
  ],
  "Soil": [
      {"soilPH": { "value": "", "span": [start_index, end_index] }},
      {"soilTexture": { "value": "", "span": [start_index, end_index] }},
      ...
  ],
  "Location": [
      {"country": { "value": "", "span": [start_index, end_index] }},
      {"city": { "value": "", "span": [start_index, end_index] }},
      ...
  ],
  "Time Statement": [
      {"startTime": { "value": "", "span": [start_index, end_index] }},
      {"endTime": { "value": "", "span": [start_index, end_index] }},

    Title: 
 Long-term field trial on tillage and fertilization in crop rotation - Westerfeld
Abstract_text_1: 
 Long-term field trial on tillage and fertilization in crop rotation - Westerfeld.
Abstract_text_2: 
 The long-term field trial started 1992 in Bernburg, Saxony Anhalt, Germany (51°82' N, 11°70', 138 m above sea level). The soil is a loess chernozem over limestone with an effective rooting depth of 100 cm, containing 22% clay, 70% silt and 8% sand in the ploughed upper (Ap) horizon. It has a neutral pH (7.0-7.4) and an appropriate P and K supply (45-70 mg kg-1 and 130-185 mg kg-1 in calcium-acetate-lactate extract, respectively). The 1980 - 2010 annual average temperature was 9.7°C, the average annual precipitation 511 mm. On five large parcels in strip split plot design (1.2 ha each, main plots) the individual crops - grain maize (Zea mays) - winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) - winter barley (Hordeum vulgare) - winter rapeseed (Brassica napus ssp. napus) - winter wheat - are rotated. All crop residues remain on the fields. Conservation tillage cultivator (CT, 10 cm flat non-inversion soil loosening) is compared to sub-plots with conventional tillage (MP; mould-board plough, carrier board with combined alternating ploughshares, ploughing depth 30 cm, incl. soil inversion). The differentially managed soils are either intensively (Int) operated according to usual practice regarding N supply and pesticide application or extensively managed (Ext; reduced N supply, without fungicides and growth regulators).

Title: 
Efficacy of biocontrol agents against potato late blight in organic farming - A field study in Bavaria
Abstract_text_1: 
Efficacy of biocontrol agents against potato late blight in organic farming - A field study in Bavaria.
Abstract_text_2: 
The study was conducted in 2018 at two locations in Bavaria, Germany: 
Abstract_text_3: 
1) Freising, a city located in Upper Bavaria, at an altitude of 513 meters above sea level with a latitude of 48°07'N and longitude of 11°28'E. 
2) Mühldorf am Inn, a town in Lower Bavaria, at an altitude of 625 meters above sea level with a latitude of 47°45'N and longitude of 11°38'E.
Abstract_text_4: 
The soil at the Freising site was a loamy chernozem with a pH of 7.3 and an organic carbon content of 7.2%. At the Mühldorf site, the soil was a loamy chernozem with a pH of 7.2 and an organic carbon content of 7.1%.
Abstract_text_5: 
A total of four biocontrol agents were tested: Bacillus subtilis, Trichoderma harzianum, Streptomyces lydicus, and Pseudomonas fluorescens.
Abstract_text_6: 
The treatment plots were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications.
