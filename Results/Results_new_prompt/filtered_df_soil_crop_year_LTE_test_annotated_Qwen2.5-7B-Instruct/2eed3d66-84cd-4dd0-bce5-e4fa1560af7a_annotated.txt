### Instruction ###
You are an expert in Named Entity Recognition (NER) for agricultural texts, with a specialization in identifying entities related to **Crops**, **Soil**, **Location**, and **Time Statements**.

Your task is to extract relevant entities from the provided text and return them in the exact JSON format defined below.

### Extraction Categories ###
1. **Crops**
   - cropSpecies
   - cropVariety

2. **Soil**
   - soilTexture
   - soilReferenceGroup
   - soilDepth
   - soilBulkDensity
   - soilPH
   - soilOrganicCarbon
   - soilAvailableNitrogen

3. **Location**
   - country
   - region
   - city
   - latitude
   - longitude

4. **Time Statement**
   - startTime
   - endTime
   - duration

### Rules ###
- Return results **strictly** in the JSON format shown below.
- Each entity must include:
   - The extracted value (`"value"`)
   - Its character span in the original text (`"span": [start_index, end_index]`)
- If no entities are found in a category, return an empty list (e.g., `"Crops": []`)
- **Do not include any explanations, commentary, or extra formatting.** Output must be pure JSON.
- Each entity's key (e.g., `soilPH`) must match its type as defined above.
- In cases such as “winter wheat” or “summer wheat” only annotate “wheat”, as it can be the same species in both cases, which is just used for a different purpose.
- Example of annotation:  
  `"soilPH": {"value": "pH", "span": [25, 27]}`

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Crops": [
      {"cropSpecies": { "value": "", "span": [start_index, end_index] }},
      {"cropVariety": { "value": "", "span": [start_index, end_index] }},
      ...
  ],
  "Soil": [
      {"soilPH": { "value": "", "span": [start_index, end_index] }},
      {"soilTexture": { "value": "", "span": [start_index, end_index] }},
      ...
  ],
  "Location": [
      {"country": { "value": "", "span": [start_index, end_index] }},
      {"city": { "value": "", "span": [start_index, end_index] }},
      ...
  ],
  "Time Statement": [
      {"startTime": { "value": "", "span": [start_index, end_index] }},
      {"endTime": { "value": "", "span": [start_index, end_index] }},

    Title: 
 P release kinetics from vivianite, hydroxyapatite and bone char
Abstract_text_1: 
 P release kinetics from vivianite, hydroxyapatite and bone char.
Abstract_text_2: 
 The bone char used for P release experiments was produced by Bonechar Carvão Ativado Do Brasil Ltda. (Maringá, Brazil) in 2015. It has been manufactured by pyrolysis of rendered (de-fatted) bovine bones at more than 800°C. A particle size analysis of the bone char was carried out, whereby 100 g of char was divided into three particle size fractions: 200 µm, 200 - 2000 µm, and 2000 µm. The P bearing minerals used were the commercially available Ca-phosphate hydroxyapatite (Ca5[OH(PO4)3]) (Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium) and the Fe-phosphate vivianite (Fe32+[PO4]2 · 8H2O). Vivianite was prepared where 250 ml of a 0.035 M H3PO4-solution were added to solid FeSO4. The resulting 0.05 M FeSO4-solution was adjusted to pH 6 with 5 M KOH. The precipitate formed was centrifuged for 5 min at 2090 × G and washed with ultrapure water. The prepared vivianite was dried at 40°C and ground into powder using mortar and pestle. P, Ca, and Fe were determined using ICP-AES after pressure digestion or aqua regia digestion. The composition of hydroxyapatite and vivianite was verified using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area was determined with an Autosorb-1 (Quantachrome, Odelzhausen, Germany) using a multi-point BET-measurement (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) and N2 as adsorptive medium. The specific surface area of hydroxyapatite was with 68.4 m² g-1 1.7 fold higher than for vivianite with 39.5 m² g-1. Bone char had the highest specific surface area with values in the range from 92.1 to 94.8 m² g-1, increasing with decreasing particle size. P release experiments were conducted in triplicate by using a batch setup with an initial pH of 6. For this, 2.5 g of the bone char and the phosphate minerals were weighed into PE bottles. Batch solubilization experiments were performed with CaCl2 (Merck Millipore) and citric acid with the formula C6H8O7 (99 %, Alfa Aesar), adjusted to pH 6 with KOH. These reaction solutions were used in concentrations 0.01 M, 0.05 M, and 0.1 M, respectively. 50 ml reaction solution was added to the bone char samples and 40 ml was added to hydroxyapatite and vivianite samples, respectively. The samples were shaken on a horizontal shaker for 24 h at 200 motions min-1, centrifuged for 15 min at 2090 × G, and the supernatant was filtrated by using P-poor Whatman 512 1/2 filters. Following, fresh reaction solution was added to the samples. Samples for P measurement were taken after 2, 6, 24, 48, and 168 h. The cumulative P release based on 168 h with CaCl2 is very low for all used materials. While the total P release for bone char was close to the detection limit, minor P concentrations were measured for vivianite and hydroxyapatite, which increased slightly with increasing CaCl2 concentration. The use of citric acid enabled significantly more P to be solved, whereby an increase of dissolved P with increasing citric acid concentration was measured as well. At low citric acid concentration of 0.01 M, the lowest amount of P was released from bone char, where most P was released from the mineral at 0.1 M citric acid. The P release experiments were conducted from January 2015 until June 2016.
