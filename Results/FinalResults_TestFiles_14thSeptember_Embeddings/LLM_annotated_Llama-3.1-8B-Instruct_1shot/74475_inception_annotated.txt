### Explanation: ###
- Crops: 
  - SOC and SON are extracted as crop species.
- Soil:
  - "soil organic carbon" and SOC are extracted as soil organic carbon.
  - "soil organic nitrogen" and SON are extracted as soil available nitrogen.
  - "soil" is extracted as a soil reference group.
- Location:
  - No location is mentioned in the abstract.
- Time Statement:
  - "temporal development" is extracted as start time, end time, and duration.
