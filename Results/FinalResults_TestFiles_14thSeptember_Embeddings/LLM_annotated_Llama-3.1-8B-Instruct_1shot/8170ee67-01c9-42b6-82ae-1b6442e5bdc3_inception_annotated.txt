### Notes on Extraction ###

- The text mentions "winter barley 2014" which implies that the experiment started in 2013 and the harvest in 2014, but there is no explicit mention of the start time.
- The duration of the experiment is not mentioned explicitly.
- There is no explicit mention of the latitude, longitude, country, or region where the experiment took place.
- Soil texture, soil reference group, soil bulk density, and soil pH are not mentioned in the text.
- Soil organic carbon and soil available nitrogen are not mentioned in the text.
- Crop rotation includes winter barley, winter oilseed rape, winter wheat, lupine, and winter rye.
