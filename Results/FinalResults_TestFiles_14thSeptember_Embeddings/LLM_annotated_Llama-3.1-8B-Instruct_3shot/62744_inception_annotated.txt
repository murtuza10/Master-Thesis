### JSON Output ###

```json
{
  "Crops": [
    {"cropSpecies": {"value": "rye", "span": [111, 116]}},
    {"cropSpecies": {"value": "rye", "span": [174, 179]}},
    {"cropSpecies": {"value": "cereals", "span": [240, 248]}}
  ],
  "Soil": [],
  "Location": [],
  "Time Statement": []
}
```

### Explanation ###

*   The JSON output includes the identified entities from the input text.
*   In the "Crops" section, we have three entities: "rye" mentioned twice and "cereals".
*   The "span" values are calculated based on the start and end character positions from the beginning of the full text.
*   The "Soil", "Location", and "Time Statement" sections are empty since no entities related to these categories are found in the input text.
