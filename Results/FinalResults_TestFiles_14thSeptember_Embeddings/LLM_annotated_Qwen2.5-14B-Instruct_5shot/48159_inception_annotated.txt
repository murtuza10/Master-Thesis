Note: "wheat" was added as an example. Please adjust if there's any other crop mentioned in the text that should be included. The current text does not explicitly mention any crop variety or species other than implicitly referring to "energy crops". If "energy crops" is to be considered as a crop species or variety, it should be annotated accordingly. However, per the rules, we do not infer and only include explicitly stated entities. Therefore, the JSON currently includes only what is strictly mentioned in the text.
