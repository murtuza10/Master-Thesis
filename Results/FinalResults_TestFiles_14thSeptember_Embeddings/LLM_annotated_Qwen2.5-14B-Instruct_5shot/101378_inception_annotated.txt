```

Explanation: The provided text does not contain any explicit mentions of crop species, varieties, soil attributes, locations (other than general mentions like "northern hemisphere" which are not specific enough), or time statements beyond the generic context of a one-year measurement period which is not explicitly stated as an entity. Therefore, all lists remain empty.
