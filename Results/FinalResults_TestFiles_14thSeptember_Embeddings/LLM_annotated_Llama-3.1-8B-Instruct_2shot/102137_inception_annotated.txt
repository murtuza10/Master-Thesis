```
### Explanation ###
1. **Crops**: None mentioned.
2. **Soil**:
   - "soil organic carbon" is mentioned twice, so it's included twice.
   - "soil cores" implies soil depth, so it's included.
   - "soil properties" implies multiple soil properties (bulk density, pH, available nitrogen), so it's included for each.
3. **Location**:
   - "Germany" is the country.
   - "temperate" is the region.
4. **Time Statement**: None mentioned.
