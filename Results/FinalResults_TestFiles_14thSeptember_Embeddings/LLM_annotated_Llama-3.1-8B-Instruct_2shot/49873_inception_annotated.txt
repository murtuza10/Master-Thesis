### Text Analysis and Entity Extraction ###

After analyzing the input text, I have extracted the relevant entities and filled the JSON structure according to the provided format.

```json
{
  "Crops": [],
  "Soil": [
    {"soilDepth": {"value": "Bodentyp", "span": [143, 149]}},
    {"soilBulkDensity": {"value": "Skelett", "span": [223, 229]}},
    {"soilOrganicCarbon": {"value": "organischer Kohlenstoffgehalt", "span": [271, 293]}},
    {"soilAvailableNitrogen": {"value": "N채hrstoffansprache", "span": [162, 175]}}
  ],
  "Location": [
    {"country": {"value": "Deutschland", "span": [13, 23]}},
    {"region": {"value": "Bundesl채nder", "span": [135, 144]}}
  ],
  "Time Statement": [
    {"startTime": {"value": "2012", "span": [246, 250]}},
    {"endTime": {"value": "2012", "span": [251, 255]}}
  ]
}
```

Note that I have only extracted entities that are explicitly mentioned in the text, without inferring any additional information. The extracted entities are:

* Soil entities: Bodentyp, Skelett, organischer Kohlenstoffgehalt, N채hrstoffansprache
* Location entities: Deutschland, Bundesl채nder
* Time statement entities: 2012 (start and end date)

Each entity is represented as a dictionary with the key corresponding to the entity category and the value being another dictionary containing the entity value and its span (start and end character positions in the text).
