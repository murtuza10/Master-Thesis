### Explanation ###

Based on the input text, the following entities were identified:

- **Crop**: "wheat" is mentioned in the abstract text as part of the plant-soil system and as a factor in the study.
- **Soil**: Several soil-related entities were identified:
  - "soil properties" is mentioned in the abstract text as being affected by the increasing number of GCFs.
  - "soil water stable aggregation" is mentioned as being negatively affected by the higher level of GCFs.
  - "soil organic carbon" is mentioned in the abstract text as a factor affected by microplastics.
  - "soil available nitrogen" is not explicitly mentioned in the abstract text, but is included based on the context of the study and the keywords provided.

Note that some entities, such as "microplastics" and "global change factors," were not included in the output as they do not fit the predefined entity categories.
