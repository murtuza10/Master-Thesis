### Notes ###
- The term "wine" is inferred as the crop species from "wine berries".
- Years are categorized under `Time Statement` rather than a specific type such as `startTime`, `endTime`, or `duration` since the exact type wasn't specified and only the year was mentioned.
- No location or soil-related terms were found in the text.
- Crop varieties (`Riesling`, `Felicia`, `Regent`) are annotated under `cropVariety`.
