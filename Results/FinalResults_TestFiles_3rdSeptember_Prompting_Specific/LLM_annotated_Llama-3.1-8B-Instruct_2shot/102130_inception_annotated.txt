### Entities Extraction and JSON Output ###

```json

  "Crops": [
    {"cropSpecies": {"value": "C4", "span": [74, 76]}},
    {"cropSpecies": {"value": "C3", "span": [103, 105]}}
  ],
  "Soil": [
    {"soilReferenceGroup": {"value": "C3 soil", "span": [104, 110]}},
    {"soilReferenceGroup": {"value": "C4 roots litter", "span": [69, 81]}}
  ],
  "Location": [],
  "Time Statement": [
    {"startTime": {"value": "6 months", "span": [94, 102]}},
    {"startTime": {"value": "12 months", "span": [111, 119]}},
    {"startTime": {"value": "24 months", "span": [135, 143]}},
    {"endTime": {"value": "2 years", "span": [19, 25]}}
  ]
}
```

### Explanation: ###

- **Crops:** The text mentions "C4" and "C3" as crop species, so they are extracted as such.
- **Soil:** "C4 roots litter" and "C3 soil" are extracted as soil references. "C4 roots litter" is annotated as a soil reference because it's added to the soil.
- **Location:** There is no explicit mention of a location in the text.
- **Time Statement:** The text mentions time intervals "6 months", "12 months", "24 months", and "2 years". "6 months", "12 months", and "24 months" are extracted as start times, while "2 years" is extracted as an end time.
