### Notes ###
- The text mentions "winter wheat" as a crop species.
- The text mentions various locations including Germany, Brandenburg, Uckermark, and Quillow. However, "Quillow" seems to be a specific location, so it's annotated as "location" instead of "city".
- The text mentions a time period from April to June 2019, so the start and end times are annotated accordingly.
