### Explanation of the JSON Structure Filled Based on the Input Text

1. The `Crops` list is empty because there are no mentions of crops in the text.
2. The `Soil` list includes several soil-related entities:
   - `"soilTexture"`: The text mentions "soils" which can be inferred as the texture of the soil.
   - `"soilReferenceGroup"`: The text mentions "soil properties" which is a reference group for the soil.
   - `"soilDepth"`: The text mentions "several" sites which can be inferred as the depth of the soil.
   - `"soilBulkDensity"`, `"soilPH"`, `"soilOrganicCarbon"`, and `"soilAvailableNitrogen"`: These entities are empty because they are not mentioned in the text.
3. The `Location` list is empty because there are no mentions of locations in the text.
4. The `Time Statement` list is empty because there are no mentions of time-related entities in the text.
