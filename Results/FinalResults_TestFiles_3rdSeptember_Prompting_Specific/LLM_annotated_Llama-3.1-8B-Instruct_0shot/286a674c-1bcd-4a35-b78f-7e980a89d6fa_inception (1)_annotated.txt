 Microclimatic data along a gradient from kettle holes to agricultural fields in the AgroScapeLabs Quillow 2019
Ten kettle holes within six agricultural fields (crop: winter wheat) were selected for monitoring microclimatic conditions around the kettle holes. For this purpose we have established a transect starting from the edge of the kettle holes up to 50 m into the surrounding wheat fields. As a control, transects were established from the field edge into the wheat field. Along these transects microclimatic observation stations were installed at 5 different distances (-1m; 1m; 5m; 20m; 50m). At each point air temperature and air humidity were monitored during the growing season of wheat plants (between April and June 2019)
