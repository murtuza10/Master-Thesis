Please note that the `Soil` category has been used instead of specific subcategories as the provided text does not give specific mentions of soil texture, reference group, depth, bulk density, pH, organic carbon, or available nitrogen. If you want the soil mentions to be split into subcategories, please provide further instructions on how to classify them.
