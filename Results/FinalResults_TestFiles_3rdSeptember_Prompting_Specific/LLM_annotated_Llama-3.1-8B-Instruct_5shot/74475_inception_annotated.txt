### JSON Output ###
```json
{
  "Crops": [],
  "Soil": [
    {"soilOrganicCarbon": {"value": "soil organic carbon", "span": [61, 78]}},
    {"soilAvailableNitrogen": {"value": "soil organic nitrogen", "span": [92, 108]}}
  ],
  "Location": [],
  "Time Statement": [
    {"duration": {"value": "temporal development", "span": [145, 155]}}
  ]
}
```
### Explanation ###
From the input text, we can see that SORCERING is a framework for modeling soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil organic nitrogen (SON). Therefore, we can extract the following entities:

*   **Soil**: We can see that SORCERING models the fate of soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil organic nitrogen (SON). This gives us two entities: `"soilOrganicCarbon"` and `"soilAvailableNitrogen"`.
*   **Time Statement**: We can see that SORCERING can predict the "temporal development" of SOC. This gives us one entity: `"duration"`.

Since there are no mentions of crops or locations in the text, the corresponding entities in the JSON output will be empty.
