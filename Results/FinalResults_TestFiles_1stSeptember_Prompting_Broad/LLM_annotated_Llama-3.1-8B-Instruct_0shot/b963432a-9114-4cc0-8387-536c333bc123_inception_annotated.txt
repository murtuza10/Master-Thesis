### Notes ###
- The redox potential (Eh) was measured in situ, but this is not explicitly mentioned as an entity in the JSON output.
- The location "Rostock" is mentioned in the title and abstract_text_1, so it is annotated in both.
- The entity "Germany" is inferred from the text, but it is not explicitly stated. The entity "Northern Germany" is explicitly stated, so it is annotated instead.
- The entity "2018" is explicitly mentioned as the year when lysimeter monoliths were collected, so it is annotated as a start time.
- The entity "2020" is explicitly mentioned as the year when data were collected, so it is annotated as an end time.
- The duration of about 3.5 months is explicitly mentioned, so it is annotated as a duration.
