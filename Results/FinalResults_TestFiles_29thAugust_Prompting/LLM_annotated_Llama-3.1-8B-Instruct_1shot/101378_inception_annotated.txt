Explanation:

*   We found a mention of the crop species "Betula pubescens" in the text, so we added it to the "Crops" list.
*   We did not find any mentions of crops in the text, so the "Crops" list only contains the "cropSpecies" entity.
*   We did not find any mentions of soil-related entities in the text, so the "Soil" list is empty.
*   We did not find any mentions of locations (countries, regions, cities, latitudes, or longitudes) in the text, so the "Location" list is empty.
*   We found a mention of a time period ("one year") in the text, so we added it to the "Time Statement" list.
