### Notes ###

- The only time statement extracted is the year 1984 when the trial was set up.
- The location mentions Germany and the city of Speyer multiple times, but they are extracted only once under the "country" and "city" categories, respectively.
- No soil-related entities were found in the text.
- Crop species like winter wheat, winter barley, and sugar beet are extracted multiple times due to their repeated mentions in the text.
