### Explanation ###
- The text does not mention any crop species or varieties.
- The text mentions "soils" which is related to the soil category, but not a specific soil property. We can include it as `soilReferenceGroup`.
- The text mentions "organic carbon" which is related to the soil category, specifically `soilOrganicCarbon`. However, it is not explicitly mentioned as a soil property, so we will include it as `soilTexture`.
- The text does not mention any specific location.
- The text does not mention any time-related information.
