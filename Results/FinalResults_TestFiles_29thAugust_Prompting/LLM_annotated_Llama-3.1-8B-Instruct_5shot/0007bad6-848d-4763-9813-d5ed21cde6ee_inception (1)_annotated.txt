### Notes ###
- The input text does not contain any information about soil texture, reference group, depth, bulk density, pH, organic carbon, available nitrogen, location, or time statements.
- The only crop mentioned in the text is "Winter wheat".
- Since the input text does not provide any information about the other soil properties, they are left empty in the JSON output.
