### Explanation ###

- **Crops**: The only crop mentioned in the text is "Mais" (which is German for "corn" or "maize"), so there is only one entry in the "Crops" list.
- **Soil**: The soil is described as a "Parabraunerde" and it is made of "Löss". The soil depth is also mentioned as 28 cm. Therefore, there are three entries in the "Soil" list.
- **Location**: There is no mention of a specific location in the text, so the "Location" list is empty.
- **Time Statement**: The experiment was conducted in 2017, so there is one entry in the "Time Statement" list.
