### Output JSON Structure ###
```json
{
  "Crops": [],
  "Soil": [
    {"Soil": {"value": "soil organic carbon", "span": [97, 116]}},
    {"Soil": {"value": "soil organic nitrogen", "span": [129, 146]}},
    {"Soil": {"value": "SOC", "span": [148, 151]}},
    {"Soil": {"value": "SON", "span": [155, 158]}},
    {"Soil": {"value": "SOC", "span": [275, 278]}}
  ],
  "Location": [],
  "Time Statement": []
}
```
### Explanation ###

1.  The text mentions "soil organic carbon" and "soil organic nitrogen" in the abstract, which are related to the soil entity. These are extracted as separate entities in the "Soil" list.
2.  The text also mentions "SOC" (short for soil organic carbon) and "SON" (short for soil organic nitrogen), which are extracted as separate entities in the "Soil" list.
3.  The text does not mention any crops, locations, or time statements, so the corresponding lists in the JSON structure remain empty.
