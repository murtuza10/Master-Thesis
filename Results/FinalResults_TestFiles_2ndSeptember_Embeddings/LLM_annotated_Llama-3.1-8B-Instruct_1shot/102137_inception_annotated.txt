### Explanation: ###

- In the text, "cropland" and "grassland" are explicitly mentioned as different types of agricultural land, which can be classified as crops. 
- The text does not explicitly mention any soil properties, so the "Soil" list is empty.
- "Germany" is explicitly mentioned as the country where the study took place, so it is included in the "Location" list.
- There is no mention of time or duration in the text, so the "Time Statement" list is empty.
