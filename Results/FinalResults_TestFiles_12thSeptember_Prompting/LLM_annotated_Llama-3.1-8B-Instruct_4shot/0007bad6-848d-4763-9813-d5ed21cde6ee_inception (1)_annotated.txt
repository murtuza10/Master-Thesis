### Explanation ###

*   The input text mentions "winter wheat" as the crop species, which is annotated as "wheat" due to the instruction to extract only the species name from compound names.
*   The text mentions "soil properties" and "soil water stable aggregation" as soil-related entities, which are annotated as "Soil" entities.
*   The text does not mention any specific locations, so the "Location" list is empty.
*   The text does not mention any time-related entities, so the "Time Statement" list is also empty.
