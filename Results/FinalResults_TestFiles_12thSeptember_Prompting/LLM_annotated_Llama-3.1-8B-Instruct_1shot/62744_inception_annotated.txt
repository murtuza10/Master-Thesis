### Explanation ###
- **Crops**: The crop species mentioned in the text are "rye" (Secale cereale L.) which appears three times in the text. Each mention is annotated as a separate object in the "Crops" list.
- **Soil**: There is no mention of soil in the text, so the "Soil" list is empty.
- **Location**: The location mentioned in the text is "Germany", which is annotated as a city in the "Location" list. Note that "Germany" is not a typical city name, but in this context, it refers to the country where the study was conducted.
- **Time Statement**: There is no mention of time or dates in the text, so the "Time Statement" list is empty.
