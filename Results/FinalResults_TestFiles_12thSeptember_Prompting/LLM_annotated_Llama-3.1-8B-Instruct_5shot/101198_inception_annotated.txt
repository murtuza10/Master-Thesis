### Explanation ###
The input text does not contain any information about crops, soil, or locations. However, it does contain information about a time period, specifically the years 2020 and 2050. These years are mentioned in the context of a study on the effects of different policies and societal trends on the wood market. The study uses a model to simulate the production of wood and wood-based products in different scenarios. The text mentions that the model simulates the production of wood and wood-based products in 180 countries from 2020 to 2050, and that the results show an increase in the supply of raw wood of up to 38% between 2020 and 2050.
