### Explanation ###
- In the "Crops" section, I identified the following crop species:
  - "barley" (two mentions)
  - "Hordeum vulgare" (one mention, which is the scientific name for barley)
  - "wheat" (one mention)
- The "Soil", "Location", and "Time Statement" sections are empty since there are no mentions of soil, location, or time-related entities in the given text.
