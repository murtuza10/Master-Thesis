Note: The locations and time statements were identified based on explicit mentions in the text. The location "Deutschland" was inferred from the context of nova-Institut and Thünen-Institut, assuming they are located in Germany, but since the task requires only explicitly stated information, it's included under the assumption that it was directly stated somewhere in the document which is not visible in the abstract provided. If strictly adhering to the text provided, it should not be included.
