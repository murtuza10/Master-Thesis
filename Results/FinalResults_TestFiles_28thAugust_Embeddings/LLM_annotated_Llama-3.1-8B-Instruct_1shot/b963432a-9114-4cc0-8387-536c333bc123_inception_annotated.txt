### Explanation ###
This JSON output is generated based on the input text. The entities are identified and extracted according to the specified categories and rules.

*   In the "Crops" category, three crop species are identified: "barley" is mentioned twice, and "serradella" is mentioned once.
*   In the "Soil" category, most of the entities are empty because they are not explicitly mentioned in the text. However, the "pH" entity is extracted from the text.
*   In the "Location" category, the country "Germany" and the region "Northern" are identified. The city "Rostock" is mentioned twice, but only one instance is included in the output.
*   In the "Time Statement" category, several time-related entities are extracted, including start times for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, as well as an end time for 2020. The duration of the experiment is also mentioned as "about 3.5 months".
