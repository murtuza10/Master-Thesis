### Note: ###
- In the given text, "forest" is not explicitly mentioned as a crop species, but rather as a forest site water budget modelling and forest growth modelling. Hence, it is not included in the "Crops" list.
- There is no specific mention of soil in the given text, hence the "Soil" list remains empty.
- The longitude value is mentioned in decimal degrees, so I included it in the "longitude" list.
- The duration is calculated as "2013-1961 = 52 years", but this is not an exact match for the "duration" key. However, since the "duration" key is not explicitly mentioned in the text, I used the calculated value for the demonstration.
