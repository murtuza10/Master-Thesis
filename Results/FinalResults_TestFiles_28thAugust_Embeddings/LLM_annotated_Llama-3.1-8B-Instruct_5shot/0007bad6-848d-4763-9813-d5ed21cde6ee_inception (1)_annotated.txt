### JSON Structure Filled with Input Text Entities

```json
{
  "Crops": [
    {"cropSpecies": {"value": "wheat", "span": [342, 348]}},
    {"cropSpecies": {"value": "wheat", "span": [381, 387]}}
  ],
  "Soil": [
    {"soilOrganicCarbon": {}},
    {"soilAvailableNitrogen": {}},
    {"soilWaterStableAggregation": {"value": "soil water stable aggregation", "span": [266, 289]}}
  ],
  "Location": [],
  "Time Statement": []
}
```

### Explanation

1. The input text is analyzed for entities related to "Crops", "Soil", "Location", and "Time Statement".
2. The text mentions "Winter wheat" twice, which corresponds to the "cropSpecies" entity. The start and end character positions are calculated as [342, 348] and [381, 387] respectively.
3. The text mentions "soil properties" which corresponds to the "soilOrganicCarbon" entity. However, the exact value is not specified, so it is left as an empty dictionary.
4. The text mentions "soil water stable aggregation" which corresponds to the "soilWaterStableAggregation" entity.
5. The text does not mention any entities related to "Location" or "Time Statement".
6. The JSON structure is filled with the extracted entities, with their corresponding values and start and end character positions.
