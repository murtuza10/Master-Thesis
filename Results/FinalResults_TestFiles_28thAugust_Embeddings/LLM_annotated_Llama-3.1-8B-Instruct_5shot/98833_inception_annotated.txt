### Explanation ###

In this example, we can extract the following entities:

*   **Crop**: "Mais" (maize) is mentioned in the title.
*   **Soil**: 
    *   "Parabraunerde" is mentioned as the soil reference group.
    *   "Löss" is mentioned as the soil texture.
    *   "28 cm" is mentioned as the soil depth.
    *   "17 t" is mentioned as the total weight of the vehicle, which can be interpreted as soil bulk density.
*   **Time Statement**: "2017" is mentioned as the start time of the experiment.
