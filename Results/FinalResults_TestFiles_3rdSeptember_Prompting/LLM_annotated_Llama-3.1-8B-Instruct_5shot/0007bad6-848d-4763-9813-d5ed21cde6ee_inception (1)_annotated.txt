### Explanation of the Output ###
In the output, the `Crops` list contains one crop species, `Winter wheat`, which is mentioned in the abstract text.

The `Soil` list contains several soil-related entities, including `soil`, `soil water stable aggregation`, and `soil properties`, which are mentioned in the abstract text. However, the exact soil properties such as `soilPH`, `soilOrganicCarbon`, and `soilAvailableNitrogen` are not explicitly mentioned in the text, but are included in the output as they are part of the predefined entity categories.

The `Location` list is empty because no specific location is mentioned in the text.

The `Time Statement` list is also empty because no specific time or duration is mentioned in the text.
