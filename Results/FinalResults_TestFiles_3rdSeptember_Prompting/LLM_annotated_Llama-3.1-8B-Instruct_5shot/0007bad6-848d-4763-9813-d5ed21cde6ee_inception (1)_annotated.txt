### Output JSON Structure ###
```json
{
  "Crops": [
    {"cropSpecies": {"value": "Winter wheat", "span": [341, 351]}}
  ],
  "Soil": [
    {"soilTexture": []},
    {"soilReferenceGroup": []},
    {"soilDepth": []},
    {"soilBulkDensity": []},
    {"soilPH": []},
    {"soilOrganicCarbon": []},
    {"soilAvailableNitrogen": []}
  ],
  "Location": [],
  "Time Statement": []
}
```
### Detailed Explanation ###
- The input text contains a mention of "Winter wheat", which is a crop species. This is the only mention of a crop in the text.
- The text does not explicitly mention any soil properties, such as texture, reference group, depth, bulk density, pH, organic carbon, or available nitrogen.
- There is no mention of a specific location.
- The text mentions several time-related concepts, such as "an increasing number of GCFs" and "a range of other important environmental drivers", but these are not specific enough to be included in the time statement category.
- Therefore, the output JSON structure contains only a single entry in the "Crops" category, corresponding to the mention of "Winter wheat". The "Soil", "Location", and "Time Statement" categories are empty.
