```
### Explanation ###

- The input text mentions the crop "rye" (Secale cereale L.) multiple times, which is correctly identified as a crop species and added to the JSON output.
- The text does not provide any information about the soil, so the "Soil" category in the JSON output is empty.
- The text mentions "Northern Europe" as the region where rye is an important crop, which is correctly identified as a location and added to the JSON output.
- The text does not provide any information about time statements, so the "Time Statement" category in the JSON output is empty.
