### Output Format ###

```json
{
  "Crops": [
    {"cropSpecies": {"value": "barley", "span": [133, 140]}},
    {"cropSpecies": {"value": "wheat", "span": [194, 199]}},
    {"cropSpecies": {"value": "barley", "span": [207, 213]}}
  ],
  "Soil": [],
  "Location": [],
  "Time Statement": []
}
```
### Explanation ###
- In the input text, "barley" is mentioned twice and "wheat" is mentioned once as crop species. Therefore, the corresponding keys in the JSON structure are populated with the extracted information.
- The `cropSpecies` key is used for all crop mentions as the text does not provide any specific variety information.
- The `soil`, `location`, and `time statement` categories are empty as there is no relevant information in the text.
