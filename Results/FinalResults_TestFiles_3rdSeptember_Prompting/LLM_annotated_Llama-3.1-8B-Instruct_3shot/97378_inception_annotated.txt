### Notes ###

- The text mentions "cropland" as a type of land use, which is classified as a crop.
- The text mentions two types of soil textures, "Lehm" and "Ton", which are classified as soil textures.
- The text mentions "Bodentextur" and "Bodenbearbeitung" as factors that differ between the fields, which are classified as soil reference groups.
- The text mentions "pH Wert", "organischen Kohlenstoff", and "Gesamt-Stickstoff" as physicochemical properties of the soil, which are classified as soil bulk density, soil organic carbon, and soil available nitrogen, respectively.
- The text mentions a duration of "14-tägigen Zeitraster" and "2 Jahre", which are classified as start and end times, respectively.
- The text mentions the city "Hildesheim" as the location of the fields.
