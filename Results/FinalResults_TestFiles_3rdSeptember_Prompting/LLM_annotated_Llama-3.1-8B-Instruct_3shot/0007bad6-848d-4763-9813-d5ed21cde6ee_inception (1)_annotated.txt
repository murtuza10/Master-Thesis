### Filled JSON Structure ###
```json
{
  "Crops": [
    {"cropSpecies": {"value": "Winter wheat", "span": [241, 253]}}
  ],
  "Soil": [
    {"soilReferenceGroup": {"value": "soil", "span": [16, 20]}},
    {"soilReferenceGroup": {"value": "soil-crop system", "span": [36, 49]}},
    {"soilDepth": {"value": "soil water stable aggregation", "span": [154, 175]}},
    {"soilBulkDensity": {"value": "soil properties", "span": [141, 153]}},
    {"soilPH": {}},
    {"soilOrganicCarbon": {}},
    {"soilAvailableNitrogen": {}}
  ],
  "Location": [],
  "Time Statement": []
}
```

Note: I have filled the JSON structure based on the input text provided. The JSON structure contains the following entities:

- "Crops": contains the species of the crop, which is "Winter wheat".
- "Soil": contains several soil-related entities, including soil reference groups, depth, bulk density, and other properties. However, some of the soil properties (soil PH, soil Organic Carbon, and soil Available Nitrogen) are not mentioned in the text and are therefore empty objects.
- "Location": is empty because there is no mention of location in the text.
- "Time Statement": is empty because there is no mention of time or duration in the text.
