### Explanation ###
1.  "Winter wheat" is extracted as the crop species because it is explicitly mentioned in the abstract text as part of the study.
2.  "soil" is extracted as the soil reference group because it is explicitly mentioned in the title and abstract text as part of the study.
3.  "soil-water stable aggregation" is extracted as the soil depth because it is explicitly mentioned in the abstract text as a property affected by the increasing number of GCFs.
4.  "soil properties" is extracted as the soil bulk density because it is explicitly mentioned in the abstract text as a property affected by the increasing number of GCFs.
5.  No location is extracted because there is no explicit mention of a specific location in the text.
6.  No time statement is extracted because there is no explicit mention of a specific time or duration in the text.
