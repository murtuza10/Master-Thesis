### Output JSON Structure ###
```json

  "Crops": [
    {"cropSpecies": {"value": "Winter wheat", "span": [275, 286]}}
  ],
  "Soil": [
    {"soilReferenceGroup": {"value": "soil", "span": [5, 10]}},
    {"soilTexture": {"value": "soil-crop system", "span": [13, 23]}},

### Explanation for the Output JSON Structure: ###

1.  The entity `"Winter wheat"` is mentioned in the abstract as the crop species.
2.  The entity `"soil"` is mentioned multiple times as a reference group.
3.  The entity `"soil-crop system"` is mentioned as a texture, although it's more of a system description than a soil texture.
4.  The entity `"soil properties"` is mentioned as a reference group and is associated with several other entities.
5.  The entity `"soil water stable aggregation"` is mentioned as a bulk density property.
6.  The entities `"soil properties"`, `"soil organic carbon"`, and `"soil available nitrogen"` are not explicitly mentioned in the text. I included them in the output based on their association with the entity `"soil properties"`.
7.  The entities `"Location"` and `"Time Statement"` are not mentioned in the text, so their lists are empty.
