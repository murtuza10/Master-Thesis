```json
{
  "Crops": [],
  "Soil": [],

```
### Explanation ###

Based on the input text, no entities related to **Crops**, **Soil**, **Location**, or **Time Statement** were found. The text does not mention any crop species, soil properties, locations, or time-related statements that match the defined categories. Therefore, the JSON structure remains empty for all categories.
