### Notes ###

- We found two instances of crop species ("C4" and "C3") and no other relevant entities for "Crops".
- No relevant soil information was provided, so the "Soil" list remains empty.
- We found two time-related entities: "2 years" and "24 months", which are used as the start and end times, respectively.
