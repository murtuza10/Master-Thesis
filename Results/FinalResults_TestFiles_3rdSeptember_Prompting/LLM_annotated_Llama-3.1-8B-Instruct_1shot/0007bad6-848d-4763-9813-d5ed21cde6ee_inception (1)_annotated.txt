### Explanation ###
Based on the input text, I found the following entities:

* In the "Crops" category, I found a mention of "Winter wheat", which is a crop species.
* In the "Soil" category, no specific soil properties or characteristics were mentioned, so the lists for each soil attribute are empty.
* In the "Location" category, no specific location was mentioned, so the list is empty.
* In the "Time Statement" category, no specific time-related information was mentioned, so the list is empty.
