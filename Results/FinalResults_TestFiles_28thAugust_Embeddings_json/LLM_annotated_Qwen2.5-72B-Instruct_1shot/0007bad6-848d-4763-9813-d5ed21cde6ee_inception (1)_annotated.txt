    {"cropSpecies": { "value": "wheat", "span": [423, 428] }}
  ],

    {"soilWaterStableAggregation": { "value": "soil water stable aggregation", "span": [365, 388] }}
  ],
  "Location": [],
  "Time Statement": []
}
```

Note: The `soilProperties` and `soilWaterStableAggregation` entities are not part of the predefined categories, so they should not be included in the final output. Here is the corrected output:

```json
{
  "Crops": [
    {"cropSpecies": { "value": "wheat", "span": [423, 428] }}
  ],
  "Soil": [],
  "Location": [],
  "Time Statement": []
