        "reasoning": "**Evaluating soil extraction**\n\nI’m looking to extract entities that are explicitly mentioned. For crops, it seems there won't be any since the text focuses on soil and mentions land types like \"cropland\" and \"grassland,\" which aren’t crop species. \n\nFor soil, they specifically mention \"organic carbon\" in both the title and abstract, which means I need to extract those occurrences as single entities. I think \"soil properties\" counts as a general reference too, aligning with the rules about explicitly mentioned properties.**Clarifying soil properties**\n\nI’m focused on identifying any explicitly mentioned soil properties or types. While considering \"soil properties\" as a generic term, I see examples like \"soil texture,\" which fit. I'll definitely include \"organic carbon\" and \"soil organic carbon\" from the title and abstract since they're specific mentions. As for terms like \"soil cores\" and \"soil profile,\" they seem more about types than properties. Since \"soil\" on its own appears too generic, I'll stick to including \"organic carbon\" and \"soil organic carbon.\"**Defining soil entity extraction**\n\nI’m trying to follow the rule that each soil mention is extracted as a single entity, regardless of property type. \"Soil cores\" seems more like a type and not a property, so I'll skip that. For soil types, like classifications such as \"Chernozem,\" I think \"organic carbon\" and \"soil organic carbon\" are valid to include. However, while \"agricultural soils\" is a type, it feels more like a land use term, so I’ll leave it out. I’ll also ignore repeats of \"soil properties.\"**Analyzing location and time statements**\n\nAlright, I'm looking at the provided text. Germany is mentioned, so I can include that as the location. However, terms like \"temperate\" and \"sites\" don’t seem relevant. \n\nThere’s no time statement, meaning no dates or seasons are present. For now, that's empty. Next, I need to compute character spans to determine the start and end indices of the substrings in the full text, including line breaks and titles. This requires careful counting to reconstruct the exact text accurately since it involves precise formatting!**Constructing data structure**\n\nI’m working on the dataset, focusing on ensuring I get the string right with all the necessary newline characters included. The first file has coordinates for 16 soil cores across eight cropland and eight grassland sites. The second provides measured properties for each core, while the third does so for soil profiles.\n\nI need to be precise with spacing too, especially after \"Title:\" which includes a space before the newline. There’s an empty line before \"Abstract:\", so I must account for all these indices meticulously as I build the string step-by-step. I’ll also check for \"organic carbon\" later on.**Extracting soil entities**\n\nI need to pull out entities mentioned in the text. For crops, it seems likely there's nothing since the text focuses on soil rather than specific crop species. \"Cropland\" and \"grassland\" are just land use types.\n\nFor soil, I see there are mentions of \"organic carbon\" in both the title and abstract. I should extract \"organic carbon\" occurrences as well as any mentions of \"soil.\" The term \"soil properties\" likely counts as an explicitly mentioned soil property too, even though it's plural.**Determining soil properties**\n\nI need to identify explicitly mentioned soil properties or types. The term \"soil properties\" feels too generic to count but examples like \"soil texture\" clearly fit.\n\nI definitely want to include \"soil organic carbon\" and \"organic carbon\" from the title. There are mentions of \"soil cores\" and \"soil profile,\" but those might be more about types than properties. It seems best to focus on properties like \"organic carbon.\" Plus, earlier examples didn’t include \"soil\" by itself, making it likely it shouldn’t be counted. So, I’ll stick to \"organic carbon\" and \"soil organic carbon\" as key entities.**Extracting soil entities**\n\nThe rule states that each soil mention should be treated as a single entity, no matter the property type. I'm contemplating if \"soil cores\" could be a type, but I think it’s safer to avoid that. \n\nI'm definitely including \"organic carbon\" from the title and \"soil organic carbon\" from the abstract. While \"agricultural soils\" sounds like a type, it's more about land use and doesn't fit the criteria for soil properties. Plus, past examples didn't include \"hedgerow soils\" either, so I'll stick with just these two entities.**Identifying key elements**\n\nI've got a good starting point: Germany is mentioned, so I can extract it as the location. However, terms like \"temperate\" and \"sites\" don’t seem relevant here. \n\nAs for time statements, there are no specific dates or seasons mentioned, so that’s empty. Now, I need to compute character spans and figure out the exact positions in the provided \"full text.\" This includes managing line breaks and labels like \"Title:\" and \"Abstract.\" I’ll have to count carefully to reconstruct the precise text and calculate start and end indices for each substring.**Compiling file details**\n\nThe first file includes coordinates for 16 soil cores collected from 16 sites, with eight being cropland and eight grassland. The second file lists the soil properties measured at each core, totaling 16 per site. The third file contains soil properties measured from six individual soil profiles per site. \n\nI need to make sure to include newlines in my exact string assembly. So, I’ll carefully compile the text, including newline characters to match what the prompt provides.**Reconstructing input text**\n\nThe first file provides coordinates for 16 soil cores taken from 16 sites, split evenly between cropland and grassland. The second file contains the soil properties measured at each core, with 16 per site, while the third file features soil properties from six individual soil profiles at each site. \n\nI need to treat the input text exactly as it appears, paying attention to indentation spaces and newlines. It seems there’s an empty line after the title and before \"Abstract:,\" which I need to include when computing indices. This counting process will be a bit tedious, but I'll build the string carefully using explicit characters.**Building the full text**\n\nI'm constructing the full text for the dataset. It starts with the title: \n\n\"Title: \\nRaw data for \\\"Plot-scale variability of organic carbon in temperate agricultural soils - Implications for soil monitoring\\\"\\n\\nAbstract:\\nThis dataset is the raw data that belongs to a peer-reviewed study on the small-distance variability of soil organic carbon in agricultural soils in Germany. \n\nThis includes details about the coordinates of 16 soil cores from both cropland and grassland sites. The second and third files detail individual core and soil profile properties. I need to ensure that \"Title: \" includes a space after the colon, as indicated in the text.**Indexing text spans**\n\nThe \"Abstract:\" line has a colon followed by a newline, with no extra space. Now, I need to compute the character spans for indexing. I’ll start counting from 0 and annotate the indices as I build the string step by step.\n\nFor Segment A, \"Title: \\n\":  \n- \"T\" is at index 0, \"i\" at 1, \"t\" at 2, \"l\" at 3, \"e\" at 4, \":\" at 5, space at 6, and \\n at 7.  \nThis gives a total length of 8 so far, so the next index will be 8.  \n\nNow for Segment B, the title line:  \n'Raw data for \"Plot-scale variability of organic carbon in temperate agricultural soils - Implications for soil monitoring\"'. \n\nI still need to find the positions of \"organic carbon\" later on, and the location in Germany is mentioned in the abstract, not the title.",
