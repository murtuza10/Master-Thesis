Title: 
Influence of arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi, rice-husk-drived biochar and compost on dry matter yield, nutrients uptake and secondary metabolites responses of Iranian borage Echium amoenum Fisch & C. A. Mey

Abstract:
This study was carried out to investigate the effect of
 bio-fertilizers including mycorrhiza (MY), rice husk compost
 (RHC), and biochar (RHB) on dry matter yield,
 nutrients uptake and some secondary metabolites of the
 medicinal plant Echium amoenum Fisch & C. A. Mey. The
 experiment was conducted in a completely randomized
 design and executed with six treatments and six replications.
 Treatments comprised of T1: control, T2: MY, T3:
 RHC, T4: RHB, T5: RHC+MY and T6: RHB+MY. The following
 parameters were studied: leaf dry weight, macro
 and micro nutrient uptake, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b,
 carotenoids, proline, anthocyanin, flavonoid, mucilage
 and carbohydrate content. The results show that application
 of RHC, RHB and MY individually or in combination
 significantly affected the studied parameters in comparison
 with the control treatment. In all cases, combined
 application of bio-fertilizers together with mycorrhiza
 application (T5 and T6) had a more positive impact on
 the studied parameters compared to the application of
 each treatment alone.
