Title: 
KEYLINK: towards a more integrative soil representation for inclusion in ecosystem scale models. I. review and model concept

Abstract:
The relatively poor simulation of the below-ground processes is a severe drawback
 for many ecosystem models, especially when predicting responses to climate change
 and management. For a meaningful estimation of ecosystem production and the
 cycling of water, energy, nutrients and carbon, the integration of soil processes and
 the exchanges at the surface is crucial. It is increasingly recognized that soil biota play
 an important role in soil organic carbon and nutrient cycling, shaping soil structure
 and hydrological properties through their activity, and in water and nutrient uptake
 by plants through mycorrhizal processes. In this article, we review the main soil
 biological actors (microbiota, fauna and roots) and their effects on soil functioning.
 We review to what extent they have been included in soil models and propose which
 of them could be included in ecosystem models. We show that the model
 representation of the soil food web, the impact of soil ecosystem engineers on soil
 structure and the related effects on hydrology and soil organic matter (SOM)
 stabilization are key issues in improving ecosystem-scale soil representation in
 models. Finally, we describe a new core model concept (KEYLINK) that integrates
 insights from SOM models, structural models and food web models to simulate the
 living soil at an ecosystem scale.
