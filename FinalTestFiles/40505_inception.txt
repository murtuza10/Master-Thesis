Title: 
Enhanced expression of radish-specific proteins in a disomic rapeseed-radish chromosome addition line resistant to root-knot nematodes

Abstract:
Root-knot nematodes cause significant economic losses
 worldwide each year. Species with especially high relevance
 in the tropical and subtropical part of China are
 Meloidogyne incognita and M. javanica. The disomic rapeseed-
 radish chromosome addition line ee was shown in
 former experiments to be highly resistant against these
 southern root-knot nematodes. In this study, differentially
 expressed proteins in the roots of the addition line
 ee, its radish donor line and its rapeseed recipient line cv.
 ‘Madora’ were screened by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
 and Image Master 5.0 software. These proteins
 were identified by MALDI-TOF-TOF/MS. Three radishspecific
 proteins with an increased expression in rapeseed-
 radish addition line ee will be further analyzed for
 their potential role in nematode resistance.
