Title: 
Effects of water salinity on germination and early seedling growth of untreated and pelleted sugar beet seeds (Beta vulgaris L.)

Abstract:
Salinity is a serious abiotic stress factor as it restricts growth
 of many field crops, especially in the arid and semi-arid
 areas of the world. In this study, the effects of salinity stress
 on germination and early seedling growth of sugar beet
 seeds of different cultivars and breeding lines under laboratory
 conditions are investigated. Untreated and pelleted
 seeds of two sugar beet cultivars and five breeding lines
 were germinated at six salinity levels. The salinity levels
 were defined by electrical conductivity (EC): distilled
 water (~0 dS/m), and NaCl solutions of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10
 dS/m. In general, the results indicated that the salinity
 levels did not affect final germination percentage, but
 affected significantly emergence percentage, mean germination
 time and seedling fresh weight compared to
 control (~0 dS/m). Seedling emergence percentage was
 significantly reduced at salinity level 10 dS/m. Seedling
 fresh weight was significantly enhanced by all salinity levels
 compared to control. Mean germination time was delayed
 significantly due to increasing salinity levels. Under field
 growth condition, reduced emergence may affect the ability
 of the plants to compete for space, water and nutrients with
 weeds, or prolongs the time of vulnerability to pests and diseases.
 Therefore, it is recommended that besides the overall
 salinity resistance, seedling emergence under salt stress
 should be considered in breeding programs.
