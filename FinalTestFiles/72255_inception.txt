Title: 
Comparison of maize, permanent cup plant and a perennial grass mixture with regard to soil and water protection

Abstract:
Agricultural production of biogas maize (Zea mays L.) causes hazards to aquatic ecosystems through high levels of nitrogen (N) inputs. Newly introduced and already established perennial crops such as the cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum L.) and perennial grass mixtures offer the possibility of more environmentally friendly agricultural bioenergy production. The objectives of this field study were to quantify and compare soil mineral N, water infiltration, water runoff, soil erosion and N leaching under maize, permanent cup plant, and a perennial grass mixture. The study was conducted from October 2016 to March 2019 in Braunschweig, Germany. Plots with cup plant and grass mixture exhibited lower mineral N contents than maize, especially between 30 and 90 cm soil depth. Soil water infiltration was significantly different between the three crops. The grass mixture had the highest infiltration rates (6.2 mm/min averaged across 3 years), followed by cup plant (3.6 mm/min) and maize (0.9 mm/min). During wet periods, higher N leaching was found for maize (up to 42 kg N ha−¹ year−¹) than for cup plant (up to 5 kg N ha−¹ year−¹) or the grass mixture (up to 11 kg N ha−¹ year−¹). While runoff and erosion for cup plant and the grass mixture were negligible during the study period, considerable amounts of runoff water and eroded sediment of up to 1.5 Mg ha−¹ year−¹ were collected from the maize plots despite the near flat terrain of the experimental field. Overall, permanent cup plant proved suitable as a component for energy cropping systems to reduce the risk of N leaching and soil erosion, which is particularly important for the preventive flood protection in view of the more frequent occurrence of high intensity rainfall under climate change conditions.
