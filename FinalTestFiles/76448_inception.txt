Title: 
Colletotrichum spp. from Soybean Cause Disease on Lupin and Can Induce Plant Growth-Promoting Effects

Abstract:
Protein crop plants such as soybean and lupin are attracting increasing attention because of their potential use as forage, green manure, or for the production of oil and protein for human consumption. Whereas soybean production only recently gained more importance in Germany and within the whole EU in frame of protein strategies, lupin production is already well-established in Germany. The cultivation of lupins is impeded by the hemibiotrophic ascomycete Colletotrichum lupini, the causal agent of anthracnose disease. Worldwide, soybean is also a host for a variety of Colletotrichum species, but so far, this seems to not be the case in Germany. Cross-virulence between lupin-and soybean-infecting isolates is a potential threat, especially considering the overlap of possible soybean and lupin growing areas in Germany. To address this question, we systematically investigated the interaction of different Colletotrichum species isolated from soybean in Brazil on German soybean and lupin plant cultivars. Conversely, we tested the interaction of a German field isolate of C. lupini with soybean. Under controlled conditions, Colletotrichum species from soybean and lupin were able to cross-infect the other host plant with varying degrees of virulence, thus underpinning the potential risk of increased anthracnose diseases in the future. Interestingly, we observed a pronounced plant growth-promoting effect for some hostâ€“pathogen combinations, which might open the route to the use of beneficial biological agents in lupin and soybean production.
