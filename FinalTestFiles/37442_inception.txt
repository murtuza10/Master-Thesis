Title: 
Light microscopic studies on the development of Beauveria bassiana and other putative endophytes in leaf tissues

Abstract:
The study involved six test fungi previously recorded in
 the literature as being endophytes (Beauveria bassiana,
 Metarhizium anisopliae, Isaria fumosorosea, Trichoderma
 harzianum, Fusarium proliferatum, Chaetomium globosum),
 two plant pathogenic fungi (Ascochyta fabae, Plenodomus
 lingam) and four host plants (Vicia faba, Brassica
 napus, Phaseolus vulgaris, Zea mays). Aerial conidia,
 blastospores, or ascospores, respectively were applied
 to leaf surfaces by spraying or by infiltrating spore suspensions
 through stomata directly into the leaves.
 Observations using light microscopy showed that the
 test fungi germinated on the leaf surface but did not
 enter actively into the leaves. Within the leaves, germination
 of spores and growth of hyphae appeared to
 depend on the presence of damaged plant tissue. Various
 host reactions such as browning of epidermal cells
 and formation of papillae were observed. Colonization
 of healthy leaves by the test fungi in a manner similar
 to the pathogens A. fabae (on Faba bean) and P. lingam
 (on oilseed rape) was not observed. Spore germination
 and hyphal growth commenced when inoculated leaves
 were placed on agar medium. The results indicate that
 the test fungi possessed a saprotrophic rather than an
 endophytic life style when associated with leaf tissue of
 the studied hosts.
