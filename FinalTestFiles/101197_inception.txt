Title: 
In-Vivo and In-Vitro Investigation of Germination Rate of Buried Sclerotia, and Variability in Carpogenic Germination Among Sclerotinia sclerotiorum Isolates

Abstract:
The sclerotia of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum serve as a primary inoculum source for initiating infections. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of environmental factors on sclerotial germination under field conditions by establishing sclerotia depots to monitor apothecia appearance over four consecutive years. Additionally, the effects of soil moisture content (25%, 50%, 75%, and 95%), air temperature (10 ◦C/10 ◦C, 14 ◦C/10 ◦C, and 18 ◦C/10 ◦C), and light conditions (white and UV light) on sclerotial germination and apothecial formation were investigated under controlled conditions with a 17 h day/7 h night regime. Furthermore, variability in carpogenic germination among S. sclerotiorum isolates was examined. From 2021 to 2024, significant differences were observed in both the sclerotia germination rate and timing of germination within the season. High soil moisture, particularly prolonged wetness, and soil temperatures between 10 and 14 ◦C were key factors for apothecial formation under field conditions. Under controlled conditions, higher soil moisture levels (75% and 95%) accelerated sclerotial germination, with sclerotia incubated at 14 ◦C/10 ◦C germinating earlier after 38 days than those at 10 ◦C/10 ◦C or 18 ◦C/10 ◦C. Additionally, the type of light significantly affected apothecial formation, which was observed only in treatments exposed to a combination of white and UV light. Furthermore, significant variations were also found in the duration until sclerotia of different S. sclerotiorum isolates produced the first stipe and the first apothecium, indicating that the genetic characteristics of each isolate affect carpogenic germination.
