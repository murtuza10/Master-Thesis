Title: 
Breeding progress of nitrogen use efficiency of cereal crops, winter oilseed rape and peas in long-term variety trials

Abstract:
Breeding and registration of improved varieties with high yield, processing quality, disease resistance and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) are of utmost importance for sustainable crop production to minimize adverse environmental impact and contribute to food security. Based on long-term variety trials of cereals, winter oilseed rape and grain peas tested across a wide range of environmental conditions in Germany, we quantified long-term breeding progress for NUE and related traits. We estimated the genotypic, environmental and genotype-by-environment interaction variation and correlation between traits and derived heritability coefficients. Nitrogen fertilizer application was considerably reduced between 1995 and 2021 in the range of 5.4% for winter wheat and 28.9% for spring wheat while for spring barley it was increased by 20.9%. Despite the apparent nitrogen reduction for most crops, grain yield (GYLD) and nitrogen accumulation in grain (NYLD) was increased or did not significantly decrease. NUE for GYLD increased significantly for all crops between 12.8% and 35.2% and for NYLD between 8% and 20.7%. We further showed that the genotypic rank of varieties for GYLD and NYLD was about equivalent to the genotypic rank of the corresponding traits of NUE, if all varieties in a trial were treated with the same nitrogen rate. Heritability of nitrogen yield was about the same as that of grain yield, suggesting that nitrogen yield should be considered as an additional criterion for variety testing to increase NUE and reduce negative environmental impact.
