Title: 
Impacts of PGPR, compost and biochar of Azolla on dry matter yield, nutrient uptake, physiological parameters and essential oil of Rosmarinus officinalis L.

Abstract:
Rosemary is one of the most important medicinal plants.
 In order to study the effect of plant growth promoting
 rhizobacteria (PGPR), Azolla compost and Azolla biochar
 on dry matter, nutrient uptake, physiological parameters
 and essential oil of rosemary, a greenhouse experiment
 was conducted in a completely randomized design with
 6 replications. Treatments consisted of T1 (control), T2
 (1% (1 g 100 g-1 dry soil) Azolla compost), T3 (1% Azolla
 biochar), T4 (PGPR (P. fluorescens)), T5 (1% compost +
 PGPR) and T6 (1% biochar + PGPR). Results indicated a
 significant enhancement of dry matter, nutrient uptake,
 photosynthetic pigments, carbohydrate, flavonoid and
 essential oil contents of rosemary influenced by organic
 fertilizers compared to control, particularly with co-application
 of PGPR + compost or biochar. Proline content
 decreased in all treatments in comparison with control.
 Results indicated positive impacts of PGPR, compost and
 boichar of Azolla on rosemary production by increasing
 nutrient uptake and protecting chlorophyll from degradation
 and enhancing its content in leaves.
