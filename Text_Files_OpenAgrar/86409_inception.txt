Title: 
Dataset: Spray drift data from drones in vineyards

Abstract:
Field experiments according to ISO 22866 were conducted to determine the spray drift from Unmanned Aerial Spraying Systems (UASS) applying plant protection products in vineyards in order to collect data that can be used for drift risk assessment by authorities. Different octocopters, nozzles (standard and air induction), application parameters (height, speed) and flight patterns (longitudinal and lateral flight lines) were used. One table describes the tested variants, application parameters and average weather data. Other tables contain the drift sediment data for each variant and test replicate vs. the downwind distance as well as the wind conditions for each test replicate with a sample rate of 1/s.
