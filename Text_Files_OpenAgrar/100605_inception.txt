Title: 
sorcering: Soil ORganic Carbon & CN Ratio drIven Nitrogen modellinG framework

Abstract:
SORCERING can be used to model the fate of soil organic carbon and soil organic nitrogen and to calculate N mineralisation rates. Provides a framework that numerically solves differential equations of soil organic carbon models based on first-order kinetics and extends these models to include the nitrogen component. The name 'sorcering' is an acronym for 'Soil ORganic Carbon & CN Ratio drIven Nitrogen modellinG framework'.
