Title: 
Assessing SNP-markers to study population mixing and ecological adaptation in Baltic cod

Abstract:
This project was partly funded by the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) of the European Union (EU) under the Data Collection Framework (DCF, Regulation 2017/1004 of the European Parliament and of the Council). Cod individuals from the Bornholm Basin were collected during RV ALKOR cruises. CP and JD were supported by the BONUS BIO-C3 project, which has received funding from BONUS (Art 185), funded jointly by the EU and from national funding institutions including the German BMBF under grant No. 03F0682. Computational analyses were performed on the Abel Cluster owned by the UiO and the Norwegian metacenter for High Performance Computing (NOTUR) and operated by the UiO Department for Research Computing. The whole genome sequencing of cod samples and SNP identification for the minimal panel were funded by “The Aqua Genome Project” (221734/O30) through the Research Council of Norway.
