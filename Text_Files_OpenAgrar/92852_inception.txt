Title: 
LaForeT  Land cover and land use polygons from participatory mapping

Abstract:
Land use has been mapped in more than 70 community workshops in the LaForeT landscapes in 2017-2019. Participatory mapping was used to produce maps at the landscape level from the perspective of individuals. Mapping was carried out in workshops assembling representatives from the research landscapes. Polygons were delineated in focus group discussions on print outs of satellite images derived from Google Earth or Bing of approximately 80*120 cm. All mapped information was digitized by project staff after the workshops. Classification into land use categories was based on a project specific and four-tiered land cover and land use classification scheme. For project information see www.la-foret.org.
