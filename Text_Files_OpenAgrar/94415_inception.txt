Title: 
Working Group on Science to Support Conservation, Restoration and Management of Diadromous Species (WGDIAD; outputs from 2021 meeting)

Abstract:
Working Group on Science to Support Conservation, Restoration and Management of Diadromous Species (WGDIAD, formerly WGRECORDS), was established to provide a forum for the coordination of work on diadromous species following the disbanding of the Diadromous Fish Committee. The role of the Group is to coordinate work on diadromous species, organise Expert Groups, Theme Sessions and Symposia, and help to deliver the ICES Science Plan. The annual meeting of WGDIAD was remotely held (by WebEx) 30 August â€“ 2 September 2021. The Annual Meeting received reports from ICES Expert Groups and workshops working on diadromous species, and considered their progress and future requirements. During the meeting, the following areas were discussed in more detail: Outcomes and deliverables from ICES EGs on diadromous fish during the last year; A progress report on the International Year of the Salmon (IYS); A progress report of the work of the Intersessional Subgroup Diadromous fish (ISSG Diad) of the Regional Coordination Groups (RCGs). The subgroup has a coordinating function and identifies data collection needs for diadromous species in relation to the EU Data Collection Multi-Annual Programme (DC-MAP); The ongoing work within ICES to develop and implement a new Life-cycle Model for Atlantic salmon assessment in WGNAS; A theme session proposal for the ICES ASC 2023, to be submitted in 2022, on exotic species (and stocks) and their impact on native species and their fisheries; Potential topics for future WGDIAD symposia; A report of the ICES WGDIAD/North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC) Pacific/Atlantic salmon Round Table meeting on 1 September 2021, bringing together salmon scientists from the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean basins; Reports and updates from Unlocking the Severn Project and the Living Planet Index (LPI) For Migratory Freshwater Fish.
