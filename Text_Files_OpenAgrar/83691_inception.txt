Title: 
Dataset to: Greenhouse gas emissions from Silphium perfoliatum and silage maize cropping on stagnosols

Abstract:
To achieve the desired greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation from bioenergy, emissions from feedstock production need to be low. These emissions mainly consist of direct soil-borne GHG emissions during feedstock cultivation and indirect emissions from land use change caused by the competition between first-generation biomass and food production. Marginal land, such as low mountain ranges, is particularly suitable for feedstock production due to the small impact on indirect land-use change. However, the most common biomass crop in Europe, maize (Zea mays L.), does not achieve its full yield potential in cold, wet conditions. On such sites, cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum L.) could serve as an alternative to maize. As a perennial, cup plant provides soil protective benefits and many more versatile ecosystem services. To evaluate whether cup plant also provides nitrous oxide mitigation potential, a two-year field experiment was conducted to compare GHG emissions from cup plant and maize fields. GHG emissions were quantified using the closed chamber technique. Cup plant fields emitted on average 3.6±4.3 kg N2O-N ha-1 a-1 (-85%) less than maize fields. This corresponded to 74.0±94.1 g CO2-eq kWh-1 (-78%) less emissions per produced electrical power. However, the area (-34%) and nitrogen (-32%) productivity of cup plant were significantly lower than of maize. Hence, cup plant as a feedstock reduces direct field-derived GHG emissions compared with maize but, due to lower yields cup plant increases the risk of associated emissions from land-use change. Therefore, the increased sustainability of bioenergy from biogas by replacing maize with cup plant is heavily dependent on the performance of maize at these sites and on the ecosystem services of cup plant in addition to GHG savings.
