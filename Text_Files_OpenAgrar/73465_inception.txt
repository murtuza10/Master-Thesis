Title: 
Microsatellite marker data of Helosciadium nodiflorum L.

Abstract:
The development of SSR markers was performed by SGS Trait Genetics GmbH (Gatersleben, Germany) using a proprietary standard protocol. The nuclear DNA was extracted from the H. nodiflorum type line (Kew Gardens London, Ser. No 0200497). The partial sequencing was carried out with MiSeq (Illumina) equipment. Seventeen SSRs proved to be polymorphic and were applied to study the patterns of genetic diversity within diploid Helosciadium nodiflorum. The results of the study will likely be published by I. Mewis, A. Naumann, M. Zander, U. Schirmak, M. Nachtigall, M. Bönisch, L. Frese, C. Ulrichs. (in prep.): Evaluation of genetic diversity of Helosciadium nodiflorum in Germany – A wild relative of celery. 
 SSR data presented in the excel file were generated by HU Berlin, Germany. Helosciadium nodiflorum plants were sampled at 20 localities in 2015 or 2016 and analyzed using 17 polymorphic SSR markers. All individuals (86 in total) having a null allele at any of the marker loci were excluded from the dataset presented here. The raw data were binned and statistically analyzed in 2018-2019. The data sheet contains information on 514/600 plants in total, respectively.
 The genetic reserves for wild celery species are part of a nationwide "Network of Genetic Reserves in Germany" (https://www.genres.de/fachportale/kultur-und-wildpflanzen/in-situ-erhaltung-von-wel/netzwerk-genetische-erhaltungsgebiete-deutschland/). The intraspecific diversity of wild celery species was assessed and representative plant populations maximizing this diversity were selected. A network of genetic reserves, comprising at least 45 plant populations, is to ensure that the intraspecific diversity of the wild celery relatives is preserved.
