Title: 
Data set: Annually mulched wild flower strips increase the observed wild bee (Apiformes) species richness and abundance in vineyard fallows in the short term

Abstract:
The present dataset contains the complete list of bee individuals sampled for a study that investigated the effects of different habitat management treatments in vineyard fallows on bee communities. Bees were sampled in 10 vineyard fallows in the Moselle region (Rhineland-Palatinate, SW Germany), which were partially subjected to different treatments (mulching, sowing of wild flower strips, combination, and untreated control). In total, 9323 individuals from 140 bee species were sampled with hand netting and pan traps in 2013 and 2014. The list of bee individuals contains information on sampling details (site, treatment variant, date, time, method) as well as information on the collected bee individuals (operational taxon, determined genus and species based on morphological identification, sex). An additional data sheet contains information on the location of the study sites.
