Title: 
Dataset: Quality parameters of different collectors in combination with the fluorescent dye pyranine

Abstract:
The data provide an overview of the research on the interaction of the fluorescent dye pyranine with the collectors: Tyvek, paper patches, plastic foil, labels, nylon filters, fiberglass filters and petri dishes. A number of sheets with data on blank value, recovery rate, storability, and UV radiation are included in the Excel file. For each collector, the blank value was examined three times. When measuring the recovery rate, different collectors use different numbers of repeats. Here, between 5 and 50 repeats were used. Data on the recovery rate for all collectors during various time periods is presented on the sheet of storability. The collectors have different target concentrations, storage times, and repeat numbers. The final sheet shows the raw data used for the analysis of the UV-degradation of every collector. For 15 to 30 minutes, all collectors were exposed to UV radiation. For each collector, the number of repetitions was the same.
