Title: 
Experimental raw data from the assessment of operator exposure during the filling process - Closed Transfer Systems (CTS)

Abstract:
The data includes raw spectrofluorometric measurements (Device: Kontron Instruments SFM25) and volume measurements from two experimental parts of the trial program (see related resource for detailed information). Subject of the program was the investigation of operator exposure during the filling process of a field crop sprayer with concentrated Plant Protection Products (PPP). In several experiments, the exposure of different dosimeters (Visor, Protective Gloves, Laboratory Gloves, Overalls and Underwear) was evaluated. The fluorescent tracer dye pyranin with a concentration of 5 g/l was used as a substitute for PPP.
