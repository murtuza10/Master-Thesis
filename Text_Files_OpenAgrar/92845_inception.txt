Title: 
sorcering: Soil ORganic Carbon & CN Ratio drIven Nitrogen modellinG framework

Abstract:
SORCERING can be used to model the fate of soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil organic nitrogen (SON) and to calculate N mineralisation rates. It provides a framework that numerically solves differential equations of SOC models based on first-order kinetics. Thus, SOC models can be simply defined and run to predict the temporal development of SOC. Beyond this, SORCERING determines the fluxes of SON and N mineralisation / immobilisation. Basic inputs are (1) the model parameters of a given SOC model expressed as the C transfer matrix (including information on decomposition and transfer rates between model pools), (2) the initial distributions of C and N among model pools and (3) time series of C and N inputs and rate modulating environmental factors. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm is used to numerically solve the system of differential equations.
