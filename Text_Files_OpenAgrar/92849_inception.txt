Title: 
LaForeT Inventories: Forest inventory data of the LaForeT project.

Abstract:
In each LaForeT landscape approx 12 forest inventory plots were selected with prestratified random selection to cover the different forest types ranging from reference and low disturbance forests to plantation monocultures. Each plot contains four satellites on which all trees and palms (all in Ecuador, most important commercial palm species in the Philippines, and none in Zambia) with a diameter at breast height (dbh) â‰¥ 10 cm as well as deadwood components were measured. In addition, soil samples for a subsample of inventory plots were analyzed. For project information see www.la-foret.org.
