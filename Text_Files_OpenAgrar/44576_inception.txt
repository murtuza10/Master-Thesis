Title: 
NFI 2012 water budgets and drought stress indicators database

Abstract:
The NFIWADS database contributes results from process-based water balance simulations with the hydrological model LWF-BROOK90 to the plots of the German National Forest Inventory (NFI). Using the climate and soil data from the databases "NFI 2012 environmental data base climate" and "NFI 2012 environmental data base site unit and characteristic soil profile" from the project “Forest roductivity, carbon sequestration, climate change”, more than 150 water budget, soil moisture, and drought stress indicators were derived for standardised beech and spruce stands. The data cover a retrospective period (1961-2013) and three climate change projections (2011-2050) based on MPI ESM ECHAM6 RCP scenarios (2.6, 4.5, 8.5) simulated with the STARS model. The database contains monthly, seasonal, and yearly water budget, soil moisture, and drought stress indicators. Zeitliche Abdeckung/Temporal coverage: 1961-2050.
