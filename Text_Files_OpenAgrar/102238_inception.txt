Title: 
The legacy of one hundred years of climate change for organic carbon stocks in global agricultural topsoils - full dataset

Abstract:
This zip folder contains a txt and a shp file with predicted soil organic carbon stocks for a total of 931149 points on agricultural land across the globe at three different timepoints. The initial value (2018) for the scenarios c (constant carbon input) and v (variable carbon input) was derived from the FAO GSP Global SOC map published in 2018. the values in 1969 and 1919 are the results of backwards modelling with RothC model to estimate past climate change effects on SOC stocks. Details can be found in the publication " The legacy of one hundred years of climate change for organic carbon stocks in global agricultural topsoils" as published in Scientific Reports.
