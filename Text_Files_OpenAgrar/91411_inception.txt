Title: 
Video recording of the over the cow scenario for estimating dermal exposures during the application of a urease inhibitor

Abstract:
In cow cattle farming, the drag hose system application technique is used to automatically apply a urease inhibitor on the stable floor to reduce ammonia emissions. A risk assessment is required for using UI. As result, measured exposure data can be used to improve risk assessment models and better reflect reality. The video demonstrates a first methodical approach to estimating and calculating the maximum possible dermal exposure with the drag hose application technique and the worst case scenario over the cow on an life like cow dummy. In the investigated scenario, the life like cow dummy is placed in the direction of travel of the application unit. The drag hoses run over the life like cow dummy. Using the number of nozzles and the duration of their contact with the life like cow dummy, the maximum amount of liquid that could be applied using the nozzles' specified application rates (three times AirMix 110-25; twice AirMix 110-04 OC) was computed. The experiments were conducted under controlled conditions in the testing facility at Kiel University's Institute of Agricultural Engineering, where the drag hose system was installed.
