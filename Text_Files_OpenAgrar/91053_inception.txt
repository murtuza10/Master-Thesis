Title: 
Data set: Comparison of two different experimental environments for resistance screenings for leafhopper-transmitted wheat dwarf virus in wheat

Abstract:
Wheat dwarf virus is an important pathogen in wheat and other cereals. Evaluation of tolerant/resistant genotypes was previously based on inoculation with virus-bearing leafhoppers and subsequent phenotyping in gauze houses under semi-field conditions. Within an improved procedure, plants are inoculated in the greenhouse under an infection hood and subsequently planted out in gauze houses. To compare the two methods, temperature profiles were established for both variants (2- Temperature profile) and the optimal inoculation time for inoculation under an infection hood in the greenhouse was determined (3-Inoculation time). In addition, a test panel of 80 genotypes (1-plant material) was phenotyped for both variants for germination rate (4-Germination rate), infection status, symptom score and relative virus titer (5- Gauze house, 6-Inoculation hood). The methods used to generate the data are described within Pfrieme, A.K. et al.: Comparison of two different experimental environments for resistance screenings for leafhopper-transmitted wheat dwarf virus in wheat.
