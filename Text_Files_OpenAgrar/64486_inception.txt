Title: 
Three-year benthic macroinvertebrate monitoring in ditches of the apple orchard region ‘Altes Land’

Abstract:
The data presented are related to the research article 'Chemical and biological monitoring of the load of plant protection products and of zoocoenoses in ditches of the orchard region Altes Land', which is only available in German. The benthic macro invertebrate data presented here were acquired from four ditches (three ditches were located in apple orchards, and one ditch was located in a grassland region) between 2001 and 2003. It is related to two field data sets, in which pesticide monitoring data and zooplankton monitoring data from the same ditches and time period have been presented.
