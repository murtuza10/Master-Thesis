Title: 
Non-invasive method to measure the dermal exposure of amphibians to pesticides

Abstract:
Pesticide exposure of amphibians is difficult to assess due to the various possible exposure
 routes and the movement behavior between aquatic and terrestrial habitats (EFSA, 2018). In
 particular, little is known about the dermal uptake of pesticides in field, which appears to be
 very important for amphibian’s exposure risk and survival (Llewelyn et al., 2019). We have
 used swab samples to measure pesticides on the skin of amphibians which possibly originate
 from contact to contaminated soil, sediment, water, plants or air. We investigated adult
 amphibians, nine common toads (Bufo bufo) and one common frog (Rana temporaria), which
 were trapped in and around maize fields in North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) in summer
 2018. About 10 cm² of the ventral and dorsal side of each animal were swabbed separately
 using individual sterile Dryswab™ with fine tip rayon buds. The selection of pesticides based
 on a proposal for a representative monitoring in the framework of the “Implementation of the
 National Action Plan on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides” (UBA, 2019). The substances
 were extracted with a solution of water/methanol (1:1, 1% formic acid) from the swabs. The
 amounts were measured with liquid and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We detected
 terbuthylazine in samples of three animals. Plant protection products containing
 terbuthylazine may be used in the pre- and post-emergence (BBCH 10-17) of maize with
 maximal 750 g/ha (BVL, 2018). The highest amount of 75 pg/cm² was found on the ventral
 side of a toad. This amount corresponds to 0.001% of the maximum application rate permitted
 for maize fields. The detection of terbuthylazine in swab samples from animals in and around
 maize fields is an expression of the spatio-temporal behaviour of amphibians.
