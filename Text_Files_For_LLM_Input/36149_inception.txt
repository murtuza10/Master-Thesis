Title: 
GHG-DB-Thuenen – Multi-variable experimental data set of agronomic data and gaseous soil emissions of energy crop cultivation at eight sites in Germany

Abstract:
The database (GHG-DB-Thuenen) contains gaseous emission data as well as agronomic variables and management activities for three years (2011/2012 – 2014/2015) at eight field trials in Germany derived from two joint research projects. The database was developed with Microsoft Access Database 2007-2016 and stores 43 million records. Multi-variable data sets consists of gas fluxes (carbon dioxide, nitrous dioxide, methane and ammonia), crop parameters (ontogenesis, aboveground biomass, grain and straw yield, N and C content, etc.), soil characteristics (nitrogen content, ammonium-N, nitrate-N, bulk density etc.), continuously recorded meteorological variables (air and soil temperatures, radiation, precipitation, etc.), management activities (sowing, harvest, soil tillage, fertilization, etc.), and its metadata (methods, further information about variables, etc.). In addition, N2 data were measured and analyzed. Also available are site-specific calculated C and N balances for the respective crops and crop rotations.
