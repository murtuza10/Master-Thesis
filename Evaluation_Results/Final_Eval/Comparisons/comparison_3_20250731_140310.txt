 Abstract_text_1 : 
  50 years box plot experiment in Grossbeeren ( 1972 - 2022 ) - Plots . 
 Abstract_text_2 : 
  The Box Plot Experiment in Grossbeeren was set up in 1972 to investigate the effect of different fertilization strategies within an irrigated vegetable crop rotation system for three different soils . Therefore , this vegetable long - term fertilization experiment can be used to investigate different plant - soil - systems under the same climatic conditions . The experimented was halted in 2022 . The experimental site ( 52 ° 21’01.30 ’’ E , 13 ° 19’05.47 ’’ N , 50 m a.s.l . ) is located in the transition zone between the more maritime - affected Northern German Plain and the continental climate of the European mainland . Weather data were collected in an agrometeorological station close to the experimental area . The long - term means ( 1991 - 2020 ) for air temperature and annual precipitation are 9.7 ° C and 492 mm . The single plots are quadratic concrete boxes with walls of 10 cm thickness , a surface area of 4 m2 and a depth of 75 cm . The upper 50 cm are filled with the tested soils ; the lower 25 cm comprises a coarse - sandy drainage layer . The three soil types are Arenic Luvisol ( weak loamy sand ) , Gleyic Fluvisol ( heavy sandy loam ) and Luvic - Phaeozem ( medium clayey silt ) according to the World Reference Base – WRB ( and the Bodenkundliche Kartieranleitung – KA4 ) . Within 10 rotations , the vegetable species white cabbage ( Brassica oleracea L. var . capitata f. alba ) , carrot ( Daucus carota L. ) , cucumber ( Cucumis sativus L. ) , leek ( Allium porrum L. ) and celery ( Apium graveolens L. var . rapaceum Mill . ) were cultivated . No celery was cultivated during the first rotation . The experiment consists of 12 fertilization treatments in different combinations of mineral N fertilization and organic amendments and as quadruplicate for each of the three soils . The experimental set - up scheme can be found in the supplementary material . Mineral N fertilizer was applied as calcium ammonium nitrate . Mineral P and K fertilization was uniform for all treatments . Total N and total C in soil , plant and organic amendments were determined using a CNS analyser VARIO El ( Elemental Hanau ) since 1995 and before by wet combustion with K2Cr2O7 und H2SO4 . C and N in the soil samples and N in the plant samples were analysed annually . The C contents of the crop residues ( leaf + stalk + root ) of the five vegetable species were investigated irregularly . In autumn , the soil was annually dug up to 20 cm by using a spade . Weeds were removed by a combination of mechanical ( cultivator , rake or hoe ) and chemical measures . Insect protection nets , insecticides or fungicides were used where necessary . Approximately 150 mm per year was additionally irrigated with a sprinkler system . More details about the experiment ’s description can be found in the supplementary material .
