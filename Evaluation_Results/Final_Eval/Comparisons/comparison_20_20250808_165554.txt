  Determination of spider mite abundance in soil of field - grown cucumbers and in plants under predatory mite pressure in invasive infestations using HRM real - time PCR assay ( Part 2 of data collection , table KERSTEN_ET_AL_DATA_FIG5 ) . 
 Abstract_text_2 : 
  Between 2017 and 2019 we studied the abundance of spider mites in the soil to estimate the potential infestation pressure of soil colonizing spider mites . The spider mites were heterogeneously distributed in small concentrations in the soil . Soil colonizing spider mites did not affect spider mite abundance on plants and reversed . We observed that spider mite migration occurred primarily from the edge of the field adjacent to the weed strip . In 2020 and 2021 , we investigated the efficacy of the predatory mite Neoseiulus californicus ( McGregor ) for suppressing spider mite hotspots in the cropland . We compared untreated spider mite hotspots with N. californicus treated hotspots and showed that a single release of predatory mites could result in a high level of control when spider mite infestation density was initially high . With this study , soil can be ruled out as a habitat for spider mites , and attention to spider mite pest control can be directed to plant infestations . The highly sensitive HRM real - time PCR assay was used for the quantification of the spider mites . Tetranychus urticae served as reference . Research domain : Soil Sciences Research question : Does the soil serve as a shelter for spider mites and must the soil be included in control strategies ? Does invasive infestation by spider mites occur on crops starting from the soil ? Can the targeted use of predatory mites contain spider mite hotspots ? table KERSTEN_ET_AL_DATA_FIG5 : Spider mite abundance in the phyllosphere and soil of an open field cucumber cultivation . Plot dimensions were 500 m long and 30 m wide included 19 plants rows and 6 transects . Three to five leaves and two soil samples were collected at one sampling point and merged together for analysis . Quantification of spider mites in the samples was conducted by HRM real - time PCR ( spider mite number/ 100 g sample ) . Related datasets are listed in the metadata element ' Related Identifier ' .
