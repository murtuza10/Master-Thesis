  Westerfeld : Long - term field trial on tillage and fertilization in crop rotation - PLOT . 
 Abstract_text_2 : 
  The long - term field trial started 1992 in Bernburg , Saxony - Anhalt , Germany ( 51 ° 82 ' N , 11 ° 70 ' , 138 m above sea level ) . The soil is a loess chernozem over limestone with an effective rooting depth of 100 cm , containing 22 % clay , 70 % silt and 8 % sand in the ploughed upper ( Ap ) horizon . It has a neutral pH ( 7.0–7.4 ) and an appropriate P and K supply ( 45–70 mg kg-1 and 130–185 mg kg-1 in calcium - acetate - lactate extract , respectively ) . The 1980–2010 annual average temperature was 9.7 ° C , and the average annual precipitation was 511 mm . On five large parcels in strip split plot design ( 1.2 ha each , main plots ) the individual crops grain maize ( Zea mays ) , winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) , winter barley ( Hordeum vulgare ) , winter rapeseed ( Brassica napus ssp . napus ) , and winter wheat are rotated on the main plots and grown in parallel . All crop residues remain on the fields . Conservation tillage with a cultivator ( CT ; 10 cm flat non - inversion soil loosening ) is compared to sub - plots with conventional tillage ( MP ; mould - board plough , carrier board with combined alternating ploughshares , ploughing depth 30 cm , incl . soil inversion ) . The differentially managed soils are either intensively ( Int ) operated according to usual practice regarding N supply and pesticide application or extensively managed ( Ext ) with reduced N supply , without fungicides , and growth regulators . The climate data are not included in the data set . They can be downloaded via the DWD 's Open Data Server because there is a DWD weather station ( ID 00445 ) in Bernburg - Strenzfeld .
