  Bacterial and archaeal abundance in top and subsoil samples in a field trail with mechanical strip - wise subsoil loosening and addition of biocompost   - Codes . 
 Abstract_text_2 : 
  In German agricultural system , more than 50 % of nutrient and water stocks are in the subsoil , but in more than 71 % of agricultural fields , supplies are not accessible for the plants based on root - restricting soil layers . To allow the crops an easier access to deep soil layers a mechanical strip - wise subsoil loosing with the addition of biocompost ( DLB treatment ) was established in frame of Soil3 project ( for further details : Schmittmann et al . 2021 ) . In this study , the influence of subsoil management on microbial community composition was investigated 2020 in a field trail in Klein - Altendorf ( Bonn ) , using the three different winter wheat genotypes Milaneco , Capo and Trebelir . Thereby , exhibit the genotypes Milaneco and Capo a more deep - rooting and the genotype Trebelir a shallower rooting system . We postulate , that ( i ) the absolute abundance of bacteria and archaea will be increased in DLB treatment plots . And we expected that ( ii ) that DLB treatment will create a shift in microbial community composition , especially in the subsoil layers . Soil and roots samples were taken from 0 - 30 , 30 - 60 and 60 - 100 cm in June 2020 , at flowering time of winter wheat , in three biological replicates . The soil type was classified as Haplic Luvisol ( Hypereutric , Siltic ) and is characterized by a silty clay loam texture with clay accumulation in the subsoil ( between 45 and 95 cm soil depth ) . The copy numbers of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and archaeal 16S rRNA gene was quantified by quantitative real - time PCR ( qPCR ) . Subsequently , 16S amplicon sequencing was performed for all bulk soil and root samples and raw sequencing data is available at the sequencing read archive ( SRA ) under the BioProject PRJNA1129315 ( SAMN42150195 , SAMN42152877 ) . Our data indicate a slightly increase in bacteria in soil samples among all genotypes and soil depths , this trend is not so evident for abundance of archaea in soil samples . For root samples an increase in bacterial and archaeal abundance was only observed for the genotype Capo , especially for the depths 0 - 30 and 30 - 60 cm . Alpha diversity was increased in the deep - rooting genotypes in root samples . In soil samples only for the genotype Milaneco a strong increase in alpha diversity was observed , especially in the samples from 30 - 60 cm . Furthermore , beta diversity for soil and root samples was only influenced by the different sampling depths but not by the genotype or the treatment . In addition , the shared ASVs representing the core microbiome , in soil and root samples , contain more shared ASVs between the genotypes per each depth in DLB treatment in comparison to control plots .
