Title : 
 Dataset for " Towards an ecosystem capacity to stabilise organic carbon in soils " 

 Abstract : 
 This dataset includes the data that was used in the Global Change Biology publication " Towards an ecosystem capacity to stabilise organic carbon in soils " by Poeplau et al .. It contains two xlsx files , with dataset_full.xlsx including all sites with soil properties that were used in the first part of the manuscript . It is a combined dataset from several open source datasets with a total of 1396 individual sites . The file modelled_converged.xlsx includes the RothC model results of a total of 587 sites , for which modelling was possible and a convergence of measured and modelled data was reached . Both files include two sheets , one with a short explanation of the variable names and one data sheet .
