Title : 
 Dataset : Residues of boscalid and pyraclostrobin in several bee matrices along the transfer pathway from plants to larvae 

 Abstract : 
 The data set contains the raw data for the corresponding publication Wueppenhorst et al . ( 2024 ) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2024.10.008 Residues of two commonly used fungicides ( boscalid and pyraclostrobin ) were measured in several bee matrices along a transfer pathway from plants to larvae . The samples were collected simultaneously at five different locations in Germany ( Bochum , Braunschweig , Celle , Hohenheim , Veitshöchheim ) from spring 2022 to spring 2023 . Therefore a field study was carried out in which honey bee colonies were placed to oilseed rape ( Brassica napus , OSR ) fields . The formulation Pictor ® Active was applied to the treatment field site according to label instructions at the maximum field recommended rate of 1 L ( product)/ha . No applications were conducted at a second field site , which was designated as the negative control . Samples of plant inflorescences , honey bee pollen baskets , honey sacs , stored pollen and nectar , in - hive bees , larval food jelly ( royal , worker , and drone jelly ) , and larvae ( queen , worker , and drone larvae ) were collected in a time dependent interval and analyzed for residues of the active ingredients . The data set contains all raw data of the measured residue concentrations within each sample . Detailed information about the sampling and methodology can be found in the corresponding publication .
